# question-asker — LESSONS ARCHIVE (verbose run-by-run history)

> Full run history, moved out of `SKILL.md` to keep it lean (not auto-loaded into context).
> Durable, project-agnostic patterns are distilled in `SKILL.md` → "Converged lessons".
> **Protocol:** append one entry per skill run below; when a pattern proves itself across runs,
> promote it into `SKILL.md` "Converged lessons" and keep this archive as the detailed history.

## Lessons log (append every run — the self-learning loop)
Before ending a run, append what you learned: questions you wish you'd asked, a sweep step that was
missing/mis-ordered, a template that paid off, anything that made the target hard to map. This is
the most valuable 5 minutes of the session.

### 2026-06-28 — Run 1: backend `auth` feature (first SPEC in the repo)
**Target:** the `/api/auth/*` surface + `middleware/auth.js`, documenting the R1 Supabase-Auth migration.
**Sweep:** 3 parallel `Explore` agents (route+service · middleware+authz · models+config+server), then
I re-read the 3 load-bearing files in full (`authService.js`, `middleware/auth.js`, `routes/auth.js`) —
every `file:line` in the SPEC was verified against source, the maps held up 1:1.
**Questions:** 4 in one `AskUserQuestion` call (verify approach · scope cut · clients/proxy · stance);
all came back the faithful/recommended lead option. The genuinely-open one was the **JWT-verify claim
source** (JWKS+DB-lookup vs custom-claims auth-hook vs legacy HS256) — that's the load-bearing decision
for any "self-signed JWT → managed-auth-provider" migration; worth leading with.
**What paid off:** separating *already-locked-by-METHODOLOGY* decisions (proxy model, retire
member_credentials/refresh_tokens, auth_user_id) from *genuinely-open* ones up front — kept the round to 4
real questions instead of re-litigating R1. Surfacing the "legacy verify did NO DB lookup; Supabase `sub`
≠ members.id" tension in §1 framed the whole spec.
**What I'd do differently:** nothing major. For the next backend feature, reuse this SPEC's section
skeleton (it's now the de-facto feature-SPEC template — §B says shipped features are single-file).
**New pattern → promote:** for a migration feature, add a dedicated **"migration delta (what stays / what
changes)"** section (§7 here) — it's the highest-value part and keeps the faithful-vs-changed line crisp.

_Earlier note: this was a fresh ICM repo; `auth` is the first documented feature._

### 2026-06-28 — Run 2: backend `members` feature
**Target:** the five `/api/members` routes + `services/memberService.js` (+ `Member`/`MemberEmail` models).
**Sweep:** read the two load-bearing legacy files in full myself (route + service), then **2 parallel
`Explore` agents** mapped web vs iOS consumption. That consumption sweep was the whole ballgame.
**The payoff finding — "dead routes":** the agents proved **`POST /api/members` and `DELETE /api/members/:id`
are called by NEITHER client** (web creates via `/auth/register`, both manage participation via
`/program-memberships`; "delete" = unenroll, never full member deletion). That reframed a 5-route CRUD
feature into "read + self-profile-update, plus two vestigial admin routes." **Lesson: always run the
cross-app consumption sweep before assuming a backend route is live — a route existing ≠ a route used.**
**Hypothesis-first caught a real bug-shaped oddity:** legacy `createMember` (`memberService.js:38`)
destructures `password` but never persists it + writes no email → admin-created members can't log in. Led
the question with that as the hypothesis; the user chose to **fix it** (change over faithful) — wire
Supabase `admin.createUser`. **Lesson: when the faithful behavior is a latent bug, surface it as a decision
(faithful-keep vs fix-now); the user often picks fix.**
**Follow-up round locked mechanics, not vibes:** "fix createMember" implied a missing input — Supabase
`createUser` needs an **email**, but legacy `createMember` takes none. A second `AskUserQuestion` pinned the
email source (require explicit `email`) + the cleanup scope (createMember only, rest faithful) so the SPEC
stayed prescriptive. **Lesson: a "change/cleanup" answer needs a scope-pinning follow-up or the SPEC drifts
into "fix as needed."**
**Migration-column shape leak (re-sweep catch):** `getAllMembers` returns full rows; the model gained
`auth_user_id` (R1) → a faithful response must now **exclude** it to preserve the legacy shape. Subtle, only
surfaced on the completeness-critic pass. **Lesson: for any "returns full rows" handler, check whether the
migration added a column the legacy response never had.**
**Reused the auth deferral pattern:** `DELETE /:id`'s cross-feature cascade (invites/notifications/
membership-exit) is the same shape as auth `/account` → deferred → 501 under D-C1 ("reference, don't own"),
to ship when `program-memberships`/`notifications` land. Consistent staging across features.
**New pattern → promote:** "**Dead-route check via the consumption sweep**" — before speccing any backend
CRUD feature, confirm which routes each client actually calls; routes called by neither are vestigial and
get flagged (kept for parity), not treated as load-bearing.
