## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Provisioning + migration: DONE.** Scaffolding done. **Supabase provisioned** (2026-06-28): org
`RaSi Fiters` (`lxehyprifvuozciizlem`), project `rasifiters` ref **`kpadxjekpiwfkqcxtrio`**, `us-east-1`,
ACTIVE_HEALTHY; `.mcp.json` repointed. **Schema applied + data/auth MIGRATED to Supabase** (2026-06-28): all
13 tables reconcile with legacy (members 48 … notification_recipients 1304), **48/48 members created in
`auth.users` (bcrypt hashes imported, no resets) and linked via `auth_user_id`**, admin on
`admin@no-email.rasifiters.com`. Migration is idempotent (re-run = 48 skips, 0 dupes).

**Phase 2 — backend `auth`: DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE (2026-06-28).** Render web service `rasifiters-api`
(`srv-d90tgmv7f7vs73cudptg`) at `https://rasifiters-api.onrender.com` via Blueprint
`apps/backend/render.yaml` (host = **Render, not Railway** — METHODOLOGY R7). Full auth round-trip green
against migrated data (admin): login→200 (bcrypt password verified, ES256 JWT), guarded route via JWKS
verify + `auth_user_id` mapping→200, garbage token→401, refresh→200, logout→200. Fixed a migration gap
en route (placeholder members had no `member_emails` row → `002` migration + migrator patch). Vercel was
deferred at this point (no web code yet — now LIVE on `rasifiters.com`, see Phase 3).

**Phase 3 — `web`: ALL PAGES PORTED (2026-06-29).** **The entire web surface is COMPLETE — 34/34 legacy pages
ported + 2 net-new auth-recovery pages (`forgot-password`/`reset-password`) = 36 web page SPECs, all
`npm run build` ✓.** Every legacy route in `../rasifiters-webapp/src/app/**` now has a 1:1 rebuilt page (route-tree
diff is clean). The four workspace-tab groups are done (`/summary` 6/6, `/members` 8/8, `/lifestyle` 2/2,
`/program/*` 6/6) and the **public group is now complete** (`splash`/`login`/`forgot-password`/`reset-password`/
`create-account`/`privacy-policy`/`support`). **The `NotificationsGate` deferred stub is now REPLACED by the faithful
web `notifications` client (run 48, 2026-06-29)** — so the web surface is **feature-complete**, not just page-complete.
The only remaining web item is the INERT middleware ES256 note (already RESOLVED in run 20 — see the note below; not
open). **The web app is DEPLOYED + LIVE on the custom domain `https://rasifiters.com` (run 49 + domain cutover,
2026-06-29): Vercel project `rasifiters` (`prj_Eqd5XmbgXDkRRhKJPASBOcIqKF6u`, team `personal-vinayak`), git
auto-deploy on `main` wired (root `apps/web`, monorepo ignore-step), favicon/icons ported, smoke test green on the
domain.** **Next: the `ios` (SwiftUI) surface — see COVERAGE `## ios`.** Foundation history below.

**Phase 4 — `ios` (SwiftUI): STARTED — foundation scaffold ported (run 50, 2026-06-30).** Mirroring the web
kickoff, the legacy Xcode project + page-independent foundation were copied **verbatim** into `apps/ios`
(faithful 1:1; folder-synchronized groups, **same bundle ids** `com.app.rasifiters`/`.widgets`, **same version**
1.3.0/40 — the user bumps +1 at TestFlight push time). Ported: `App/` (incl. byte-faithful `AppRootView`),
`Config/APIConfig`, `Shared/Services/*` (APIClient + 9 extensions, Keychain, SessionStore, NotificationStream),
`Shared/Theme/*`, `Shared/Models/*` (ProgramContext + 8 extensions), `Shared/Components/*`,
`Shared/Views/NotificationModalView`, `Assets.xcassets`, `Info.plist`, `.entitlements`, + the self-contained
`RaSi-Fiters-App-Widgets` extension. **Deviations (logged in `apps/ios/CONTEXT.md` §Foundation port):** (1)
`APIConfig.renderBaseURL` repointed to the new `rasifiters-api.onrender.com/api` (the auth-path change — matches
web prod); (2) all 37 `Features/` screen files **deferred** (ported per-screen via question-asker, auth first);
(3) `App/_DeferredScreenStubs.swift` — minimal placeholders for the only 4 feature views `AppRootView` references
(`SplashView`/`ProgramPickerView`/`QuickAddWorkout|HealthWidgetEntryView`), the iOS analogue of web's
`NotificationsGate` stub; (4) stripped `xcuserdata`/`.DS_Store`, added `apps/ios/.gitignore`. **The iOS auth path
the CONTEXT only *leaned* toward is now LOCKED (web proved it live): backend proxies Supabase tokens, clients
change minimally — only the API base URL.** **Build:** the self-contained Widgets target compiles clean (Swift
toolchain verified); the **app target's full build green-check is owned by the user (visual run in Xcode)** — the
local CLI build is blocked only by an Xcode-install quirk (stale CoreSimulator service can't expose the new iOS
26.5 simulator runtime → `actool` asset-catalog failure), NOT by the ported code. See `apps/ios/CONTEXT.md`
§Toolchain note + memory [[ios-user-verifies-builds-visually]].

**Phase 4 — `ios` auth screens: PORTED (run 51, 2026-06-30).** The **iOS public/auth path is COMPLETE** —
`SplashView` · `LoginView` · `CreateAccountView` ported into `apps/ios/.../Features/{Onboarding,Auth}/`
(3 iOS screen SPECs at `specs/pages/ios/{splash,login,create-account}/`), the `SplashView` deferred stub
removed. **The guiding stance shifted (user steer, memory [[ios-matches-web-not-just-legacy]]): match the
CURRENT built web app, not just the legacy iOS code** — so all three cross-app divergences the web SPECs had
flagged for this port resolved toward web parity: **(1)** the real brand icon (new `BrandMark.swift` +
`BrandIcon.imageset` built from the `AppIcon` PNGs) replaces the legacy orange-circle/`chart.bar.fill`
placeholder on all three screens (closes web splash F3); **(2)** Login gains a **"Forgot your password?"**
link → `APIConfig.forgotPasswordURL` opening the live web recovery flow (the reset always completes
in-browser via the Supabase email link, so iOS opens web rather than duplicating natively — closes web login
F3); **(3)** CreateAccount adopts **all 4 web cleanups** — inline email-format validation + muted hint, a
live password-policy checklist (replacing the static hint), a muted mismatch hint, and autoFocus First Name
(web's authed-redirect cleanup is N/A — the `AppRootView` `authToken` bifurcation already handles it).
Faithful 1:1 otherwise (typewriter/`SplashViewModel`, `loginGlobal`/`registerAccount` + `ProgramContext`
session writes, the gender `Menu`, native error `Alert`s). **No new deps beyond `BrandMark`/`BrandIcon` +
the `forgotPasswordURL` constant** — every other component was ported in the foundation (run 50). **The app
target's build green-check is owned by the user (visual run in Xcode)** — symbols verified present
(`Color.appGreen`, `adaptiveShadow`, single type definitions, no duplicate `SplashView`). **Next: port
`ProgramPickerView` (the post-auth landing both Login + CreateAccount push to — still a deferred stub) +
program create/edit/invites, via `question-asker`.**

**Phase 4 — `ios` post-pick home shell: `AdminHomeView` PORTED (run 53, 2026-06-30).** The **post-auth home
shell** — the iOS analogue of the web `(workspace)` group — ported into
`apps/ios/.../Features/Home/AdminHomeView.swift` (SPEC `specs/pages/ios/admin-home/`), the deferred stub
removed. It is a **96-line native bottom `TabView`** (NOT a dashboard): 4 tabs — **Summary** (single,
`AdminSummaryTab`) · **Members** · **Lifestyle** (internal tag `workoutTypes`) · **Program** — the latter
three **role-bifurcated** `Admin*Tab`/`Standard*Tab` via `programContext.isProgramAdmin`; plus the nested
`AdminHomeView.Period` enum (W/M/Y/P) the tab bodies bind to, `.adaptiveTint()`, and
`navigationBarBackButtonHidden(true)`. **D-SCOPE = the scope cut IS the run** (run-21/50/52 pattern,
cross-platform): port the shell verbatim, **defer the 7 tab bodies as `ScaffoldPlaceholder` stubs**
(`AdminSummaryTab` carries a `period: Binding<AdminHomeView.Period>` initializer to match the shell's call
site). The 7 tab bodies drag in the whole `Tabs/Section` + `Detail/` + `Settings/` + `Sheets/` universe —
essentially the entire web `/summary`+`/members`+`/lifestyle`+`/program` surface (30+ web pages). **D-REF =
keep iOS-native `TabView`** — the web workspace is 4 top-level routes under a shared nav layout; iOS collapses
that into one native bottom tab bar. **Platform-idiom EXCEPTION to web parity** (run-52 D-REF; memory
[[ios-matches-web-not-just-legacy]]) — tab set + order already match web (Summary/Members/Lifestyle/Program),
so it is a structural idiom divergence, not a parity gap; lead "keep iOS-native". **Faithful 1:1 otherwise
(D-S1)** — no web-parity deviation (the shell is pure navigation, fetches nothing, has no behavior to diff vs
web — unlike run-52's silent-error-swallow banner). **D-DEPS = no new dependency** (`isProgramAdmin`
`ProgramContext.swift:269`, `adaptiveTint()` `AppTheme.swift:208` both ported in the foundation run 50; all 7
tab-body names collision-free). **Role rules** = the Admin*/Standard* variant table (global_admin + program
admin → `Admin*Tab`; logger/member → `Standard*Tab`; Summary identical for all); **`admin_only_data_entry`
N/A at the shell** (it gates *logging* deep in the deferred tab bodies, never the navigation). Flagged F1–F4
(role bifurcation by physically-separate views; the `workoutTypes` internal tag for "Lifestyle"; 7 deferred
tab stubs; `navigationBarBackButtonHidden`). **The app target's build green-check is owned by the user (visual
run in Xcode)** — symbols verified via grep (exactly one `AdminHomeView`, each tab body defined once,
`AdminHomeView.Period` resolves, no leftover stub), not a CLI build (memory
[[ios-user-verifies-builds-visually]]). **Next: port a TAB BODY — `AdminSummaryTab` (the dashboard cards, the
iOS analogue of web `/summary`) is the natural first — or `ProgramActionsSheet`/`EditProgramInfoView` (the
still-deferred picker forward-nav targets), via `question-asker`.**

**Phase 4 — `ios` post-auth landing: `ProgramPickerView` PORTED (run 52, 2026-06-30).** The **"My Programs"
hub** — the first post-auth iOS screen — ported into `apps/ios/.../Features/Home/ProgramPickerView.swift`
(SPEC `specs/pages/ios/program-picker/`), the deferred stub removed; the **7 forward-nav screens it navigates
to are added as `ScaffoldPlaceholder` stubs** (`AdminHomeView`, `ProgramActionsSheet`, `EditProgramInfoView`,
`MyProfileView`, `ChangePasswordView`, `AppearanceSettingsView`, `NotificationsSettingsView`). **D-SCOPE = the
scope cut IS the run** (run-21/50 pattern, cross-platform): port the picker verbatim incl. its inline
`ProgramCard`/`StatusPill`/`AccountMenuSheet`, defer everything it pushes to. **Faithful 1:1 D-S1** (the `List`
of cards over `fetchPrograms`, `canOpen`/`canManage` role gating, swipe Edit/Delete, inline invite
Accept/Decline via `updateMembershipStatus`, the floating "+" with the pending-invite badge, `applyProgram`
hydration + `persistSession` → `AdminHomeView`, delete/sign-out `Alert`s) **+ ONE web-parity deviation D-C1: a
visible error banner** — the legacy set `errorMessage` in `loadPrograms`/`deleteProgram`/`respondToInvite` but
**never rendered it** (errors silently swallowed); the web hub surfaces query errors, so iOS now shows an
additive red banner. **THE LOAD-BEARING DECISION — D-REF: keep iOS-native multi-screen navigation.** The web
`/programs` hub renders the whole flow on ONE page (create/edit/invites/account as inline modals); iOS keeps
native sheets + multi-screen navigation. Per memory [[ios-matches-web-not-just-legacy]] this is the
**platform-idiom EXCEPTION** to web parity (resolve toward web UNLESS a platform reason) — the first iOS run
where the lead answer is "keep native", recorded as D-REF + F7, NOT a reconcile-toward-web. **D-DEPS = no new
dependency** (every service/model/component/theme symbol ported in the foundation run 50; `StatusPill` collision
grep clean). Role rules = the `canOpen`/`canManage` table (global_admin opens/edits/deletes any; program admin
own; logger/member open only; invited/requested accept/decline only); **`admin_only_data_entry` N/A** (read into
`ProgramContext` for downstream log screens, never gates the picker). Flagged F1–F7 (errors-now-surfaced;
deferred forward-nav stubs; vestigial `isDeleting`; client role gating; dual invite mechanisms; iOS-only account
rows incl. Notifications+Support; single-page-hub layout not adopted). **The app target's build green-check is
owned by the user (visual run in Xcode)** — symbols verified via grep (no `StatusPill`/component collisions,
all `ProgramContext`/`ProgramDTO`/theme deps resolve), not a CLI build (memory
[[ios-user-verifies-builds-visually]]). **Next: `AdminHomeView` (the post-pick home) or `ProgramActionsSheet`
(create+invites), via `question-asker`.**

**Phase 3 — `web`: STARTED (2026-06-29).** **Foundation scaffold ported + builds green** (`apps/web`,
`npm run build` ✓ — Next.js 14 App Router, TS strict, Tailwind `rf-*` tokens, React Query + Auth + Theme
providers, edge middleware). Ported the shared page-independent infra directly (not via `question-asker` —
that loop is for pages): all `src/lib/*` (config, api/client+auth, auth session/jwt/provider, theme,
storage, permissions, format, hooks), `globals.css`, layout/providers/shell chrome, the icon library,
brand assets. Deviations (all migration-justified, logged in `apps/web/CONTEXT.md` §Foundation port): host
Netlify→Vercel (dropped `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`+`netlify.toml`, pkg renamed `rasifiters-web`); prod API
default → our Render service; **`NotificationsGate` = deferred stub** (returns null until the web
notifications feature lands — backend deferred-stub pattern). Next: the public/auth pages via
`question-asker`.

> NOTE (the `src/middleware.ts` ES256 concern is RESOLVED): the foundation scaffold's edge middleware was
> initially a faithful HS256 port (incompatible with Supabase's ES256 tokens — would have redirect-looped
> every real session). This was **fixed in run 20** (the `programs` hub, the first protected route): per
> D-C1 the middleware now **decodes + checks `exp` only** (no signature verify at the edge — the Express
> backend JWKS-verifies every API call and owns all authz), which is ES256-safe. See `middleware.ts:56-80`.
> Live + correct; not an open question.

> NOTE: the user reset the Supabase DB password on 2026-06-28 — the value in the earlier scratchpad secrets
> file is STALE; the live one is in the user's password manager + `tools/migrator/.env` (gitignored).

## Next action

> ### ⏭️ ON "continue" → PORT A TAB BODY — `AdminSummaryTab` (the dashboard, iOS analogue of web `/summary`) via `question-asker`
> **`AdminHomeView` is DONE (run 53, 2026-06-30)** — the post-pick home **shell** (a 96-line native bottom

**Phase 2 — backend.** Point the Express app at Supabase + swap auth to verify Supabase JWTs:
1. ~~Spec the backend **`auth`** feature via `question-asker`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — see
   [`specs/features/auth/SPEC.md`](specs/features/auth/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (decisions D-C1 whole-module scope /
   D-C2 JWKS+per-request DB-lookup verify / D-C3 clients-unchanged proxy / D-S1 faithful; flagged F1–F7).
   Registry + COVERAGE ticked.
2. ~~Port the backend foundation + `auth` feature into `apps/backend/`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — data
   layer (13 models + index, `config/database.js`→`DATABASE_URL`, response/errorHandler) + auth slice
   (`config/supabase.js`, JWKS-verify `middleware/auth.js`, `services/authService.js`, `routes/auth.js`,
   `server.js` mounting only `/api/auth`). `npm install` + boot-check pass. **Two follow-ups carried**
   below (`/account` 501; asymmetric JWT keys).
3. ~~Provision Render + deploy the auth backend + smoke-test login→verify→refresh→logout.~~ **DONE +
   VERIFIED 2026-06-28** — live at `https://rasifiters-api.onrender.com` (`srv-d90tgmv7f7vs73cudptg`);
   full round-trip green against migrated data (see auth SPEC §12 / session log). Service id recorded in
   `CONTEXT.md` + the `deploy-scope-guard.sh` allow-list; auth status flipped 🏗️→🚀.
4. ~~Spec + port `members`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — see [`specs/features/members/SPEC.md`](specs/features/members/SPEC.md)
   v0.1.0 (📄→🏗️). Ported `services/memberService.js` + `routes/members.js`, mounted `/api/members`. Faithful
   except the one deliberate change **D-C2** (`createMember` now creates a loginable member via Supabase
   `admin.createUser` + requires `email`); `DELETE /:id` deferred → 501 (**D-C1**, the auth `/account`
   pattern); `getAllMembers` excludes the migration-added `auth_user_id`. `POST`+`DELETE` are vestigial
   (called by neither client — **D-REF**). Boot check passes; **runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase pending**.
5. ~~Spec + port `programs`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — see [`specs/features/programs/SPEC.md`](specs/features/programs/SPEC.md)
   v0.1.0 (🏗️ built — SPEC + ported). Four `/api/programs` routes; ported `services/programService.js` +
   `routes/programs.js`, mounted `/api/programs`. Faithful except the one deliberate cleanup **D-C2**
   (`createProgram` drops the vestigial `description` field — sent by no client, unupdatable, never returned);
   the `program.updated`/`program.deleted` notification emit is **deferred** → guarded `emitProgramNotification`
   no-op (**D-C1**, wired when `notifications` lands — CRUD fully functional); `getPrograms` keeps its two raw
   SQL branches verbatim (**D-S2**); `admin_only_data_entry` is web-only (**D-REF**). Boot check passes;
   **runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase pending** (the Render auto-deploy on push).
6. ~~Spec + port `program-memberships`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — see
   [`specs/features/program-memberships/SPEC.md`](specs/features/program-memberships/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built).
   6 of 8 routes ported (`createMemberAndEnroll` fixed→loginable **D-C2**; `getAvailableMembers`+`enrollMember`
   dropped as dead routes **D-C3**); `handleMemberExit` cascade ported (`utils/programMemberships.js`);
   notification emits deferred via a **deferred stub** `utils/notifications.js` (**D-C4**); invite-table writes
   ported. Mounted `/api/program-memberships`. Boot check passes. **Runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase pending.**
7. ~~Spec + port `notifications`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — see [`specs/features/notifications/SPEC.md`](specs/features/notifications/SPEC.md)
   v0.1.0 (🏗️ built). 6 `/api/notifications` routes + the emit engine; **replaced the deferred
   `utils/notifications.js` stub** with the real `createNotification` (DB write + transactional SSE/APNs
   dispatch) + ported `utils/{notificationStreams,pushNotifications}.js` (added `apn` dep). Faithful except
   **D-C2** (the one migration delta — SSE stream auth migrated symmetric `jwt.verify` → Supabase JWKS via a
   shared `resolveReqUser` in `middleware/auth.js`, keeping the `?token=` query path) and **D-C4** (APNs creds
   deferred → `APNS_*` declared `sync:false` in `render.yaml`, push no-ops gracefully). `POST /broadcast` kept
   vestigial (no client, F1). Mounted `/api/notifications`. Boot check passes. **The keystone unblock:** the
   programs/program-memberships emit call sites now fire unchanged. **Runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase pending.**
8. ~~Spec + port `invites`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — see [`specs/features/invites/SPEC.md`](specs/features/invites/SPEC.md)
   v0.1.0 (🏗️ built). 4 routes (`POST /invite`, `GET /my-invites`, `GET /all-invites`, `PUT /invite-response`)
   **co-mounted at `/api/program-memberships`** (`server.js` — `inviteRoutes` alongside `membershipRoutes`,
   mirroring legacy `server.js:50`); ported `services/inviteService.js` + `routes/invites.js`. The
   `ProgramInvite`/`ProgramInviteBlock` models + associations were already ported (with program-memberships).
   **The keystone realized:** `program.invite_received`/`program.member_joined` emits wired **live** (D-C2,
   no stub — notifications is ported). Faithful except two cleanups: dropped vestigial `target_member_id`
   (D-C3a) + batched `getAllInvites`' N+1 into one query (D-C3b); accept-path `ProgramMembership` write stays
   inline (D-C1). Boot check (4-route stack, emit engine wired, `InvitedByMember` assoc) passes.
   **Runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase pending.**
9. ~~Wire the two deferred 501 delete cascades.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — `members DELETE /:id` (members SPEC
   v0.2.0) + auth `DELETE /account` (auth SPEC v0.2.0) now run the shared
   `utils/programMemberships.cascadeMemberDeletion` + best-effort Supabase `admin.deleteUser` after commit.
   The cascade is single-sourced (owned by program-memberships, it drives `handleMemberExit`) and shared
   verbatim by both callers; the global-admin guard, 404, transaction, and success message stay per-caller.
   Boot check passes. **Runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase pending** (Render auto-deploy on push).
10. ~~Spec + port `program-workouts`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** — see
    [`specs/features/program-workouts/SPEC.md`](specs/features/program-workouts/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built).
    6 `/api/program-workouts` routes + the 6 program-scoped fns appended to the shared `workoutService.js`
    (both halves reunited, D-C1). One deliberate change **D-C2** (per-action admin authz hoisted into a
    resolve-or-pass-through `requireProgramAdmin` route guard; service authz-free; status codes preserved;
    `GET` ungated). `consumed_by = [web, ios]` all 6 routes 1:1 (D-REF). Faithful otherwise (D-S1, F1–F7).
    Mounted. Boot check passes. **Runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase pending.**
11. ~~Spec + port `workout-logs`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-29** — see
    [`specs/features/workout-logs/SPEC.md`](specs/features/workout-logs/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built). The
    `workoutLogRouter` half of the shared `routes/logs.js`/`services/logService.js`; **2 dead GET routes
    dropped** (called by neither client, D-C1); the 4 live routes mounted `/api/workout-logs`. Four
    user-chosen cleanups (D-C2 positive-int duration / D-C3 collapse double-check / D-C4 de-dup membership
    lookups / D-C5 hoist the `admin_only_data_entry` lock to a `requireDataEntryAllowed` middleware);
    `consumed_by = [web, ios]`, `POST /batch` web-only. Faithful otherwise (F1–F9). Boot check passes.
    **Runtime smoke-test pending.**
12. ~~Spec + port `daily-health-logs`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-29** — see
    [`specs/features/daily-health-logs/SPEC.md`](specs/features/daily-health-logs/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built).
    The `dailyHealthLogRouter` half of the shared `logs.js`/`logService.js`, appended to the file pair
    `workout-logs` created (both halves reunited). 4 routes at `/api/daily-health-logs`; `consumed_by =
    [web, ios]` all 4 routes 1:1, no divergence. Two changes (D-C2 reuse `requireDataEntryAllowed` on the 3
    writes; D-C3 single-`body` PUT signature); faithful otherwise (F1–F6). Boot check passes. **Runtime
    smoke-test pending.**
13. ~~Spec + port `analytics` (v1).~~ **DONE 2026-06-29** — see
    [`specs/features/analytics/SPEC.md`](specs/features/analytics/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built). The `v1Router`
    half of the shared `routes/analytics.js`/`analyticsService.js` + the 2 analytics-only utils
    (`dateRange.js`/`queryHelpers.js`). 8 routes at `/api/analytics` (dead `participation/mtd` dropped per
    D-C2 — both clients use the v2 variant); `consumed_by = [web, ios]` all 1:1. Read-only verbatim except 2
    UTC cleanups (D-C3 distribution bucketing + D-C4 timeline labels). Faithful otherwise (F1–F7). Boot check
    passes. **Runtime smoke-test pending.**
14. ~~Spec + port `analytics-v2`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-29** — see
    [`specs/features/analytics-v2/SPEC.md`](specs/features/analytics-v2/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built). The
    `v2Router` half of the shared `routes/analytics.js`/`analyticsService.js`, appended to the v1 files (both
    halves reunited; reuses the helpers + 2 utils landed with v1). **`GET /summary` (v2) dropped** (D-C2 — the
    mirror of v1's D-C2: both clients use the v1 summary; `getSummaryV2` dead). 5 live routes at
    `/api/analytics-v2`; `consumed_by = [web, ios]` all 1:1, no divergence. Faithful verbatim (D-S1); F1–F6.
    Boot check passes. **Runtime smoke-test pending.**
15. ~~Spec + port `member-analytics`.~~ **DONE 2026-06-29** — see
    [`specs/features/member-analytics/SPEC.md`](specs/features/member-analytics/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built). Its
    **own file pair** — `routes/memberAnalytics.js` (4 separate routers) + `services/memberAnalyticsService.js`
    (4 fns + helpers), distinct from analytics/analytics-v2. 4 routes at `/api/member-{metrics,history,streaks,
    recent}`; `consumed_by = [web, ios]` all 4 routes 1:1, **no divergence**. **Enforces per-program read authz**
    (`ensureProgramAccess`, F1 — unlike v1/v2). Faithful verbatim except **D-C2** (re-export the 3 timeline
    helpers from `analyticsService.js` — restores the legacy export surface; touches the built `analytics`
    feature → patch bump) + 2 cleanups **D-C3** (extract the shared access prelude) + **D-C4** (guard null
    `start_date` in streaks). No UTC cleanup. Boot check passes. **Runtime smoke-test pending.**
16. ~~Spec + port `app-config` + push.~~ **DONE 2026-06-29** — see
    [`specs/features/app-config/SPEC.md`](specs/features/app-config/SPEC.md) v0.1.0 (🏗️ built). The **last
    backend feature** — owns the inline `GET /api/app-config` (`min_ios_version`, the iOS version gate) +
    `MIN_IOS_VERSION` env; push (APNs) is the §6 cross-reference index (already owned by `notifications`/`auth`,
    not re-documented). `consumed_by = [ios]` (web ignores both). Route kept inline (D-C1); 2 user-pinned
    cleanups applied to `server.js` — D-C2 `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` + D-C3 trim/semver-validate
    `MIN_IOS_VERSION` (malformed → `null`). F1–F5. Syntax + helper verified. **Backend feature coverage complete
    (14 features).** Runtime smoke-test deferred to the batched pre-cutover pass.
17. **NEXT — Phase 3: `web`.** Provision the Vercel `rasifiters-web` project, then spec (page/screen kind via
    `question-asker`) + port the web app feature/page by feature/page → `deploy` to a Vercel temp domain.
    Start with the public/auth path (splash → login → create-account) to prove auth end-to-end, then the
    programs hub. See Build sequence step 5.

Re-run `tools/migrator/ → npm run migrate` right before cutover to sync any rows that changed on the legacy
app in the meantime (it's the pre-cutover sync, idempotent).

## Build sequence (the locked plan — see `METHODOLOGY.md`)

1. [x] **Scaffold the ICM repo** (L1–L5 + skills + hooks). _DONE 2026-06-28._
2. [~] **Provision infra** — Supabase DONE 2026-06-28. **Render `rasifiters-api` PROVISIONED + LIVE
       2026-06-28** (`srv-d90tgmv7f7vs73cudptg`, Blueprint `apps/backend/render.yaml`, id recorded in
       `CONTEXT.md` + the deploy-scope hook). Vercel `rasifiters-web` deferred until the web app has code.
3. [x] **Migrator** (`tools/migrator/`) — BUILT + EXECUTED against Supabase 2026-06-28. Preserved
       `members.id` UUIDs, imported bcrypt hashes → `auth.users` (48/48), backfilled `members.auth_user_id`,
       idempotent re-runnable sync. Schema in `apps/backend/sql/001_schema.sql` (applied). _DONE._
4. [~] **`backend`** — point Express at Supabase, swap auth middleware to verify Supabase JWTs (proxy
       login/refresh/logout), deploy to Render (Blueprint). Spec features as we go. _Auth feature SPEC'd
       (v0.1.0) + PORTED + **DEPLOYED to Render + verified live 2026-06-28** (`/api/auth` 🚀). `members`
       SPEC'd + ported (🏗️); `programs` SPEC'd + ported (📄, `/api/programs` mounted). Remaining backend
       features (program-memberships, invites, logs, workouts, notifications, analytics…) pending._
5. [~] **`web`** — feature/page by feature/page (`question-asker` → spec → port code → `deploy` to Vercel
       temp domain). Proves the auth path end-to-end. _Foundation scaffold ported + builds green 2026-06-29
       (`apps/web`); **10 pages done** — public/auth path (splash → login → forgot → reset → create-account)
       + the `programs` hub (first protected route; resolved the middleware HS256→ES256 decision) + ALL FOUR
       workspace tabs: `summary` (read overview + desktop log-form modals) + `members` (per-member overview +
       role-gated "view as" picker, read-only) + `lifestyle` (read-only workout-type analytics + health-timeline
       overview) + `program` (4th & last tab — the settings hub: role-gated menu / non-admin read-only card +
       Leave + Sign Out; all 4 bottom-nav tabs now resolve). **The workspace landing layer is complete + the
       SUB-ROUTE layer is advancing** — `program/edit` (admin-only details form → `PUT /programs/:id`; faithful +
       3 cleanups; ported shared chrome `ui/PageHeader.tsx` + `BackButton.tsx`) + `program/roles` (admin-only
       role-management list → `PUT /program-memberships`; faithful + 3 cleanups: tokenize colors / optimistic
       update / disable-all-while-pending; ported shared chrome `ui/LoadingState.tsx`) + `program/profile` (the
       user's own "My Profile" account page — NOT admin-gated; first/last name + gender + Delete Account → `PUT
       /members/:id` + `DELETE /auth/account`; faithful + 2 cleanups: tokenize success color / clear stale message
       on edit; **no new deps — purest shape**) done. Next: the remaining 3 `/program/*` sub-routes (password ·
       appearance · privacy), the 8 deferred `/members` sub-routes, the 6 deferred `/summary` sub-routes, and/or
       the 2 deferred `/lifestyle` sub-routes._
6. [ ] **`ios`** — feature/screen by feature/screen.
7. [ ] **Cutover** — switch `rasifiters.com` (Vercel) + ship the iOS build.

## Open questions (carry until resolved)

- **Runtime smoke-tests of ported backend features are BATCHED to a pre-cutover pass (decided 2026-06-29).**
  Don't re-offer a smoke-test after each feature port — every "🏗️ built" feature carries a standing
  "runtime smoke-test pending" note and they're verified together near cutover (Build-sequence step 7).
  Needs a live admin JWT (ES256/Supabase-signed — can't be minted by Claude; the user supplies a token or
  admin credentials at that time). Boot checks (module-load + route-stack) remain the per-port gate. Live
  routes confirmed mounted via unauthenticated probes as they deploy (`program-workouts`: `GET` no-token →
  401, 2026-06-28).
- ~~**Migrator — members without a primary email:** placeholder vs skip?~~ **RESOLVED 2026-06-28** —
  placeholder (`<username>@no-email.rasifiters.com`). Affects exactly 1 row (the `admin` account); keeps
  admin able to sign in. **Gap found + fixed during deploy verify:** the migrator wrote the placeholder to
  `auth.users` but NOT to `member_emails`, so admin 401'd at login (no email to resolve) → backfilled via
  `apps/backend/sql/002_*.sql` (user ran it) + patched `tools/migrator/src/importAuth.js` to write the row.
- **iOS auth approach:** backend-proxy (clients ~unchanged) vs embed `supabase-swift`. Leaning proxy.
- ~~**Web edge middleware vs Supabase ES256 (NEW 2026-06-29):** `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` ported faithfully
  but verifies HS256; auth migrated to Supabase ES256, so it would mark every real session invalid → redirect
  loop.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-06-29 (option b)** with the `programs` page port (its D-C1): the edge middleware is
  now **decode + expiry only** — a UX redirect gate, not the security boundary. The Express backend
  JWKS-verifies (ES256) **every** API call + owns all authz (CLAUDE.md auth model — not RLS), so dropping edge
  signature-verify doesn't weaken security and avoids a per-navigation JWKS fetch; the `JWT_SECRET` dependency
  is gone. `npm run build` ✓ (Middleware 27.2 kB active). See `apps/web/CONTEXT.md` §Foundation port +
  `specs/pages/web/programs/SPEC.md` D-C1.
- ~~**Two deferred delete cascades return 501** — `DELETE /api/auth/account` and `DELETE /api/members/:id`.~~
  **RESOLVED 2026-06-28** — both wired now that program-memberships/invites/notifications are ported. The
  faithful cross-feature cascade is single-sourced as `utils/programMemberships.cascadeMemberDeletion` and
  shared verbatim, + best-effort Supabase `admin.deleteUser` after commit. Both SPECs bumped 0.1.0→0.2.0.
- ~~**Supabase JWT signing keys must be asymmetric (ECC P-256/ES256)** for the JWKS verify path (D-C2).~~
  **RESOLVED 2026-06-28** — the project's JWKS endpoint (`/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`) serves a live
  `ES256`/P-256 key (`kid 0f6cd324…`), so JWKS verify finds a key. No further action needed at deploy.
- ~~**`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` not stored locally**~~ **OBTAINED 2026-06-28** — the user supplied the anon key
  (a public anon JWT). Kept OUT of git per policy; paste it into Render as the `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  `sync: false` Blueprint secret at provisioning (alongside `DATABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
  both in `tools/migrator/.env`). All four backend env values are now in hand for the Render deploy.

## Session log (newest first)

- **2026-06-30** — **Web polish + live-test fixes (post-launch side-quests; web surface stays CLOSED → next is `ios`).**
  Three user-reported fixes against the LIVE site, all committed + deployed + manually verified by the user:
  **(1) Profile page (`/program/profile`) gender fix + net-new email change** (commit `e4712d5`; **members→0.3.0**,
  **auth→0.5.0**, profile page SPEC→0.2.0): swapped the raw native `<select>` for the shared `Select` + a shared
  `lib/genders.ts` `GENDER_OPTIONS` (also adopted by create-account); **widened `members.gender` `varchar(10)`→`varchar(32)`**
  via migration `apps/backend/sql/003_widen_gender_column.sql` (user ran it) so `"Prefer not to say"` (17 chars) stops
  erroring on save; `getMemberById` now returns the primary `email`; net-new **`PUT /auth/email`** (`changeEmail` —
  password-confirmed direct change keeping Supabase `auth.users` + `member_emails` in sync) + a profile email view/change form.
  **(2) Password-recovery link bug** — the reset email landed on `localhost:3000` + `otp_expired`. **Root cause was Supabase
  config, NOT code:** Site URL was still the dev default `http://localhost:3000` and the prod URL wasn't on the Redirect-URLs
  allow-list, so Supabase dropped `redirect_to`. **Fixed in the Supabase dashboard** (Site URL → `https://rasifiters.com` +
  allow-list `https://rasifiters.com/**`); recovery now works end-to-end **incl. Outlook**. A typed-6-digit-code variant was
  built then **reverted** (`f12ff2d` → `29693ed`) once the magic link proved fine post-config; kept in history as a fallback if
  a future inbox's link-scanner ever consumes the single-use link (would need free custom SMTP to edit the email template).
  **(3)** The previously-"unverified" signed-in web→backend proxy round-trip is now **user-verified live** (profile save, email
  change, password recovery all green). **NET DOC EFFECT: web is fully done + verified; `continue` → start `ios`.**

- **2026-06-29 (pm-10)** — **Specced + ported the `program` page (10th web page) — the FOURTH & LAST WORKSPACE
  TAB (`/program`), the program settings hub. All 4 workspace tabs now live; the landing layer is complete.**
  `question-asker` run 24. User picked `/program` (last tab) over the deferred sub-routes. The page is small, so
  I read the 541-line landing `page.tsx` in full myself and verified every dep with greps over our ported
  foundation (no Explore fan-out needed). **Key findings:** (1) a **third "name could mislead"** page (runs 22/23
  recur) — `/program` is the settings/account hub, not program-CRUD; the real editors are 6 deferred sub-routes
  (`edit/roles/profile/password/appearance/privacy`). (2) Two **role variants**: admin menu vs non-admin read-only
  Program Info card; only **Leave Program** (`PUT /program-memberships/leave`) + **Sign Out** are live on the
  landing, all else forward-nav. (3) `canLeaveProgram = !isGlobalAdmin` — a global admin is treated as
  program-admin but can't Leave (intentional). (4) **run-11 client-vs-server recurred**: the landing's
  `computeProgramProgress` is client-computed from `start_date`/`end_date`, distinct from summary's server-derived
  `progress_percent` → keep local, not a shared helper. (5) `MyAccountSection` read `rf:appearance` raw from
  `localStorage`, duplicating the foundation's `getStoredTheme()`. **Stance = faithful + 2 pinned cleanups** (user
  picked change-now → the run-6/14/22 pinning multiSelect): **D-C1** appearance label via `getStoredTheme()`,
  **D-C2** extract the byte-identical duplicated `LeaveProgramButton`; **D-C3** keep `computeProgramProgress` local
  (confirm). **Zero new deps, zero backend work, NO feature bump** — all api modules / 5 `ui/` components / 11
  icons / format-storage-theme helpers already ported, both endpoints already mounted. Ported
  `apps/web/src/app/program/page.tsx` (verbatim + D-C1/D-C2). The bottom-nav `/program` tab (already wired in
  `shell.tsx`) now resolves — **all 4 workspace tabs live.** SPEC v0.1.0 (D-REF `[web]` / D-SCOPE / D-S1 / D-C1 /
  D-C2 / D-C3; F1–F6). Page REGISTRY ticked; lessons run 24 appended. `npm run build` ✓ (`/program` prerendered,
  4.36 kB — no Recharts; Middleware 27.3 kB active). **Committed via `git-version` next. Next:** the SUB-ROUTE
  layer (6 `/program/*`, 8 `/members`, 6 `/summary`, 2 `/lifestyle`).
- **2026-06-29 (pm-9)** — **Specced + ported the `lifestyle` page (9th web page) — the THIRD WORKSPACE TAB
  (`/lifestyle`), the workout-type-analytics / health-timeline overview.** `question-asker` run 23. User picked
  `/lifestyle` (3rd tab) over the deferred sub-routes / `/program` tab. Opening sweep fanned 3 `Explore` agents
  (legacy lifestyle cluster · our ported web foundation+deps · backend API contract), and I verified the
  load-bearing files myself: the full 625-line landing `page.tsx` + the new `lib/api/lifestyle.ts` + our
  foundation's ported deps. **Key findings:** (1) **the name lies again** (run-22 pattern recurs) — `/lifestyle`
  is NOT a sleep/diet *logging* screen but a **read-only** workout-type-analytics + health-timeline dashboard,
  a near-twin of the Members tab (same view-as picker, same `MemberPickerModal` with `allowNone`, same role
  gating). The actual data-entry (workout-type CRUD) lives in the deferred `/lifestyle/workouts` sub-route. (2)
  **2** new deps — `lib/api/lifestyle.ts` (6 fns over already-mounted `analytics`/`analytics-v2` routes) +
  `ui/EmptyState.tsx` (new 10-line primitive); everything else already ported (incl. the shell `/lifestyle`
  nav tab, all 5 chart tokens, `IconDumbbell`, `fetchProgramMembers`). (3) **all 6 endpoints already mounted**
  (`server.js:74-76`) — zero backend work, no feature bump. (4) 2 forward-nav sub-routes deferred (`workouts`/
  `timeline`, F2). (5) read-only → `admin_only_data_entry` **N/A**. **Tight 2-Q round** (both user-answered):
  **D-SCOPE** = landing page only · stance = **faithful, port local `MemberPickerModal` verbatim + flag the dup**
  with Members (F6) — user declined extracting a shared picker component (I recommended against: the Members
  picker was de-dup'd into a 2-variant `activePicker` form, so sharing would add branches, not remove them).
  Ported `apps/web/src/app/lifestyle/page.tsx` + `lib/api/lifestyle.ts` + `ui/EmptyState.tsx` verbatim. `npm run
  build` ✓ (`/lifestyle` prerendered, 13.6 kB — Recharts; Middleware 27.3 kB active). Wrote
  `specs/pages/web/lifestyle/SPEC.md` v0.1.0 (D-REF `[web]` / D-SCOPE / D-S1 / D-C1 / D-C2; F1–F7: client
  JWT-decode role, forward-nav to unbuilt routes, `sessionStorage` view-as + 2 effects, highest-participation
  always program-wide, over-fetched client-sorted popularity, duplicated picker, no client throttle). Page
  REGISTRY + COVERAGE ticked (lifestyle ✓). **All this session's work committed via `git-version` next; lessons

  deferred `/summary` sub-routes, and/or the 2 deferred `/lifestyle` sub-routes.**

- **2026-06-29 (pm-8)** — **Specced + ported the `members` page (8th web page) — the SECOND WORKSPACE TAB
  (`/members`), the per-member overview / "view as" dashboard.** `question-asker` run 22. Opening sweep fanned
  3 `Explore` agents (legacy members cluster · our ported web foundation+deps · backend members/analytics API
  contract), then I verified the load-bearing files myself: the full 833-line landing `page.tsx`, the legacy
  `lib/api/members.ts`, and our foundation (`programs.ts` `fetchProgramMembers`, `format.ts`, icons,
  `chart-theme`, `useAuthGuard`, session/Program shapes). **Key findings:** (1) **the name lies** — `/members`
  is NOT a roster-management screen but a per-member overview with a role-gated **"view as"** picker; the
  roster/CRUD lives in deferred sub-routes (`/list`+`/detail`). One Explore agent *inferred* "roster management"
  + listed `fetchMembershipDetails`/`update`/`remove` as the page's deps — **my own read of the landing file
  corrected it** (the landing uses only `fetchProgramMembers` for the picker + 5 read-only member-analytics
  calls). (2) **one** new dep — `lib/api/members.ts`; everything else already ported (incl. the shell `/members`
  nav tab). (3) **all endpoints already mounted** — zero backend work, no feature bump. (4) 8 forward-nav
  sub-routes deferred (F2). (5) read-only → `admin_only_data_entry` **N/A**. **Tight 3-Q round + a pinning
  multiSelect** (all user-answered): **D-SCOPE** = landing page only · **D-C1** = port whole `lib/api/members.ts`
  verbatim · stance = *faithful + small cleanups* → the pinning multiSelect surfaced **D-C2** (hoist
  `formatDuration` → `lib/format.ts`, recommended) + **D-C3** (de-dup the two `MemberPickerModal` blocks, I
  recommended *against* — structural); user picked **both**. Implemented D-C3 behavior-preserving via an
  `activePicker` discriminant (the admin + logger pickers are mutually exclusive; kept the admin path's
  `allowNone`/`"none"`-storage nuance). Ported `apps/web/src/app/members/page.tsx` + `lib/api/members.ts`; added
  `formatDuration` to `lib/format.ts`. `npm run build` ✓ (`/members` prerendered, 7.78 kB — Recharts; Middleware
  27.3 kB active). Wrote `specs/pages/web/members/SPEC.md` v0.1.0 (D-REF `[web]` / D-SCOPE / D-S1 / D-C1 / D-C2 /

  Opening sweep fanned 3 `Explore` agents (legacy web summary cluster · our ported web foundation · backend
  API contract for summary), then I verified the load-bearing files myself: the legacy 606-line
  `summary/page.tsx`, `lib/api/{summary,logs}.ts`, the 3 `forms/*`, `Input`/`Button`/`program-workouts.ts`, and
  our foundation's `shell.tsx`/`permissions.ts`/`storage.ts`/`chart-theme.ts`/`client.ts`. **Key findings:**
  (1) selecting a program on the hub does `saveActiveProgram` → `router.push("/summary")` — **`/summary` is a
  top-level route** reading the active program from `localStorage`, NOT a `[id]` route; (2) the charts are
  **inline Recharts** (no chart components to port) and our `chart-theme.ts` already exports all 5 tokens the
  page imports; (3) `shell.tsx` already activates the bottom-nav for `/summary`; (4) **all 11 backend endpoints
  the page consumes are already ported + mounted** (`server.js:73-76`); (5) the page drags in 4 not-yet-ported
  deps (`lib/api/{summary,logs,program-workouts}.ts`, `ui/{ErrorState,Input,Button}`, the 3 `forms/*`), whose
  transitive deps (`cn`, `useIsMobile`, `Select`, `fetchProgramMembers`, `apiRequest`) are all present. **Tight
  3-Q round (all user-answered):** **D-SCOPE** = *landing + the 3 log-form modals this run* (desktop write path
  end-to-end; the 6 sibling sub-route pages — 3 detail + 3 mobile log fallbacks — deferred as their own rows,
  links to them are forward-nav F2); **D-S1** = *faithful 1:1*; **D-C1** = *one typed cleanup*
  (`ProgramProgressCard` `summary?: any` → `AnalyticsSummary`, the type already in `summary.ts`); role-based
  view rules confirmed faithful (canLogForAny + dataEntryLocked). Ported (verbatim `cp`) the 9 dep files +
  `src/app/summary/page.tsx`, then applied the D-C1 edit. `npm run build` ✓ (`/summary` prerendered, 107 kB —
  Recharts; Middleware 27.2 kB active). Wrote `specs/pages/web/summary/SPEC.md` v0.1.0 (D-REF `[web]` / D-SCOPE
  / D-S1 / D-C1; F1–F7: client JWT-decode role, forward-nav to unbuilt routes, vestigial-here api fns, week-only
  landing period, over-fetched summary fields, dead form `variant="page"` branch, no client rate-limit). Page
  REGISTRY + COVERAGE ticked (summary ✓; logging forms ✓ as modals). **All this session's work committed via
  `git-version` next; lessons run 21 appended. NEXT = the 6 deferred `/summary` sub-routes and/or the sibling
  workspace tabs (`/members`, `/lifestyle`, `/program` settings).**

- **2026-06-29 (pm-6)** — **Specced + ported the `programs` hub (6th web page) — the FIRST PROTECTED route —
  and RESOLVED the standing `middleware.ts` HS256→ES256 open question.** `question-asker` run 20. Opening sweep
  fanned 3 `Explore` agents (legacy web programs hub · our ported web foundation + `middleware.ts` · backend
  programs/memberships/invites API contract), then I verified the load-bearing files myself
  (`apps/web/src/middleware.ts`, the legacy 1022-line `programs/page.tsx`, the legacy `api/{programs,invites}.ts`,
  `useAuthGuard`). **Key findings:** (1) `GET /api/programs` already returns the exact per-user shape the hub
  needs (`my_role`/`my_status`/`total_members`/`active_members`/`progress_percent`/`admin_only_data_entry`),
  global-admins all programs / members only their own; (2) the page drags in **2 api modules + 5 `ui/` components**
  not yet in the foundation (the run-19 "page pulls in shared deps" pattern), but their transitive deps (`cn`,
  `formatInviteDate`) are already ported. **Tight 3-Q decision round (all user-answered):** **D-C1** middleware =
  *decode + expiry only* (the faithful HS256 verify is non-viable against Supabase ES256; the backend
  JWKS-verifies every API call + owns authz, so the edge is just a UX redirect gate — no per-nav JWKS fetch,
  `JWT_SECRET` dropped); **D-C2** dependency port = *verbatim* (whole `lib/api/{programs,invites}.ts` modules +
  the 5 `ui/` components the page uses, not all 12 legacy `ui/` files); **D-C3** stance = *faithful + reuse
  `useAuthGuard({requireProgram:false})`* (replacing the inline login-redirect `useEffect`). Ported (verbatim
  `cp`): `apps/web/src/lib/api/{programs,invites}.ts`, `src/components/ui/{PageShell,GlassCard,Modal,ConfirmDialog,
  StatusBadge}.tsx`, `src/app/programs/page.tsx` (+ the D-C3 edit); rewrote `src/middleware.ts` (decode+expiry,
  removed the HS256/secret path). `npm run build` ✓ (`/programs` prerendered, 11.3 kB; Middleware 27.2 kB —
  now active, was inert). Wrote `specs/pages/web/programs/SPEC.md` v0.1.0 (D-REF `[web]` / D-S1 / D-C1 / D-C2 /
  D-C3; F1–F6: client JWT-decode role, forward-nav to unbuilt `/summary`+`/program/*`, dual invite mechanisms,
  edge gate no signature-verify, vestigial-here api fns + `enrollments_closed`, no client rate-limit). Page
  REGISTRY + COVERAGE ticked (programs ✓); `apps/web/CONTEXT.md` §Foundation-port middleware note flipped to
  RESOLVED; the open question marked resolved. **All this session's work committed via `git-version` next;
  lessons run 20 appended. NEXT page = `program` overview / the first workspace tab `/summary`** (where a
  selected program lands).

- **2026-06-29 (pm-5)** — **Specced + ported the `create-account` page (5th web page) — the public/auth path
  (splash → login → forgot → reset → create-account) is now COMPLETE.** `question-asker` run 19. Opening sweep
  fanned 3 `Explore` agents (legacy web create-account · our ported web foundation+sibling pages · backend
  register route). **Key code-grounded findings:** (1) the backend `register` (`authService.register`) **already
  requires + normalizes + format-validates email** + enforces the password policy + creates the Supabase Auth
  user — so D-PLAN item 3 ("sign-up email mandatory + format-validated") was already satisfied *server-side*;
  the only delta was the *client* page; (2) `register` returns **no token**, so the legacy page (faithfully)
  **register-then-auto-logs-in** via `login()`; (3) `registerAccount()` already existed in our `api/auth.ts`;
  (4) the gender dropdown needs `Select` (+ `SelectMobile`), **neither ported yet** → ported both verbatim as
  the dependency; (5) legacy create-account had **no already-authed redirect**, unlike all 3 sibling auth pages.
  Tight **3-Q round** then a scope-pinning multiSelect. Decisions (all user-answered): **D-S1** faithful port +
  **D-C1** inline email-format validation (D-PLAN item 3; reuses forgot-password's `EMAIL_RE`; forward-only) +
  **D-C2** already-authed → `/programs` redirect (matches siblings; legacy had none) + **D-C3** live
  password-policy checklist (✓/○ per rule, mirrors `validatePassword`) replacing the static hint — *merges the
  two password-hint cleanups the user selected* (the live checklist subsumes the conditional-hint behavior by
  appearing on first keystroke) + **D-C4** muted confirm-mismatch hint + **D-C5** autoFocus First Name. **No
  auth-feature bump** (the `register` route + client fn pre-existed — this run added only the page + the
  `Select` components). Ported `apps/web/src/app/create-account/page.tsx` + `src/components/{Select,SelectMobile}.tsx`;
  `npm run build` ✓ (`/create-account` prerendered, 6.25 kB). Wrote `specs/pages/web/create-account/SPEC.md`
  v0.1.0 (D-REF `[web]` / D-S1 / D-C1–C5; F1–F6: client JWT decode, register-then-login no-rollback, bootstrap
  form flash, no client rate-limit, no client username rules, cleanups web-first/iOS gap). Page REGISTRY +
  COVERAGE ticked (create-account ✓). **All this session's work committed via `git-version` next; lessons run 19
  appended. NEXT page = the `programs` hub** (first protected route — resolve the `middleware.ts` HS256→ES256
  decision first; see Open questions).

- **2026-06-29 (pm-4)** — **Specced + ported the `reset-password` page (4th web page, 2nd net-new) + the
  NET-NEW backend `POST /auth/reset-password` (auth 0.3.0→0.4.0); the auth-recovery path is now END-TO-END.**
  `question-asker` run 18. Opening sweep verified the sibling `forgot-password` page/SPEC, the auth SPEC
  (0.3.0), the backend `authService.js`/`routes/auth.js` (confirmed `changePassword` already does the
  Supabase admin update + the password policy; `authenticateToken` JWKS-verifies any Supabase access token),
  and the web `api/client.ts`/`api/auth.ts`. **Key code-grounded finding:** supabase-js 2.108.2 defaults to
  the **implicit** flow, so `resetPasswordForEmail` lands the recovery session in the **URL fragment**
  (`#access_token=…&type=recovery`) — and PKCE is architecturally unusable here (backend initiates, an
  arbitrary browser completes; the verifier would be stranded server-side). Tight **3-Q** round on the
  genuinely-open decisions (user picked all the recommended/lead options): **Backend design** = *Bearer +
  reuse `changePassword`* (page sends the recovery token as the Bearer; route = `authenticateToken` + the
  existing `changePassword(req.user.id, new_password)` — single-sourced, no bespoke service fn); **Post-reset
  dest** = *in-page success → `/login?reason=password-reset`* (recovery stays separate from login; no Supabase
  session embedded — clean R1; auto-login rejected); **Form fields** = *new + confirm + inline policy hint*
  (mirrors server `validatePassword`; consistent with forgot's D-C2 inline-validation divergence). **Ported:**
  backend `POST /auth/reset-password` (`routes/auth.js`) reusing `authenticateToken` + `changePassword`;
  pinned `flowType: "implicit"` on the Supabase clients (`config/supabase.js`, defensive — already the
  default). Web: `resetPassword(accessToken, newPassword)` (`api/auth.ts`), `app/reset-password/page.tsx`
  (BrandMark + new/confirm fields + Show/Hide + inline policy + match hints + success banner →
  `/login?reason=password-reset` redirect; reads + scrubs the fragment token; 401 → "request a new link"
  invalid-link state → `/forgot-password`; already-authed-without-token → `/programs`), and a new green
  `password-reset` banner case on the login page (login SPEC → v0.1.1). Boot check passes (`POST
  /reset-password` mounted, `authenticateToken` + handler, mw=2); `npm run build` ✓ (`/reset-password`

  REGISTRY + COVERAGE ticked (reset-password ✓). **All this session's work committed via `git-version` next.
  NEXT page = `create-account`** (+ sign-up-email-mandatory, D-PLAN item 3).

- **2026-06-29 (pm-3)** — **Specced + ported the `forgot-password` page (3rd web page, the FIRST net-new
  one) + the NET-NEW backend `POST /auth/forgot-password` (auth 0.2.0→0.3.0).** `question-asker` run 17.
  Opening sweep verified the link source ([login/page.tsx:156-163](apps/web/src/app/login/page.tsx#L156)
  already renders the D-C1 "Forgot your password?" → `/forgot-password` link), the web config/API/client
  patterns, and the ported auth stack — confirming `resetPasswordForEmail` is **unused** and the reset must
  proxy through Express (R1; `changePassword` already uses `supabaseAdmin.updateUserById`). Most behavior was
  pre-locked by login's D-PLAN, so a tight **2-Q** round on the genuinely-open decisions: **Scope** = *"Page +
  forgot route only"* (user — build the page + the one route it calls this run; **`reset-password` page +
  `POST /auth/reset-password` = next run**, another auth MINOR bump → 0.4.0); **Email field** = *add inline
  email-format validation* (user — the field is email-only, unlike login's username-or-email identifier; a
  deliberate divergence from login's no-validation F5). **Ported:** backend `requestPasswordReset`
  (`services/authService.js` — always-200 generic message, no enumeration; calls Supabase
  `resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo: PASSWORD_RESET_REDIRECT_URL })` only when email is format-valid;
  swallows errors) + public `POST /forgot-password` (`routes/auth.js`) + `PASSWORD_RESET_REDIRECT_URL` in
  `render.yaml` (=`https://rasifiters.com/reset-password`, forward dep). Web: `SUPPORT_EMAIL` (`config.ts`,
  `vinay.sankara@gmail.com` placeholder), `requestPasswordReset()` (`api/auth.ts`), and
  `app/forgot-password/page.tsx` — BrandMark + email field + inline format hint + "Send reset link", generic
  green success replacing the form, an **always-visible `mailto:` "Contact us" fallback** (both states) for
  no-email accounts, "Back to login", already-authed → `/programs`. Boot check passes (route mounted public,
  1 handler; `requestPasswordReset` exported); `npm run build` ✓ (`/forgot-password` prerendered, 3.94 kB).

  **All this session's work committed via `git-version` next. NEXT page = `reset-password`.**

- **2026-06-29 (pm-2)** — **Specced + ported the `login` page (2nd web page spec) + established the
  auth-recovery path plan.** User opened by mandating the auth follow-up set: Supabase Auth was chosen for
  easy self-service recovery, so login/sign-up/account pages must GAIN forgot/reset-password (web first, then
  iOS), with a **dual** forgot-password (emailed reset when an email exists; a `mailto:` "contact us" fallback
  for the placeholder no-email accounts), and **sign-up email must become mandatory + validated for new
  members** (forward-only). Saved this as a durable memory. `question-asker` run 16 (page mode): fanned 3
  `Explore` agents (legacy web login · legacy iOS auth · our ported web+backend auth) — **confirmed
  forgot-password/reset/email-verification exist on NEITHER client** (100% net-new), our `register` already
  creates a loginable Supabase user w/ email (members D-C2), and Supabase `resetPasswordForEmail` exists but
  **no backend route calls it**. Verified the legacy login file + ported foundation myself. **4-Q decision
  round (all user-answered):** **Scope** = *login page only + plan rest* (forgot/reset/signup-changes +
  backend bump are their own follow-ups); **Reset trigger** = *always-send + always-visible contact link*
  (privacy-safe, supersedes the earlier "detect then branch" idea); **Reset path** = *through Express backend*
  (R1); **Support email** = `vinay.sankara@gmail.com` (placeholder, may change). Updated the memory to match.
  Ported `apps/web/src/app/login/page.tsx` — **faithful 1:1** (identifier+password, Show/Hide, `?reason`
  banner, JWT decode → `setSession` → `/programs`, already-authed redirect, create-account + Privacy links)
  **+ ONE addition (D-C1): a "Forgot your password?" link → `/forgot-password`**. `npm run build` ✓ (`/login`
  prerendered, 4.04 kB). Wrote `specs/pages/web/login/SPEC.md` v0.1.0 (D-REF/D-S1/D-C1/D-PLAN; F1–F5: client
  JWT decode, no bootstrap gate/form flash, iOS recovery gap, no client rate-limit, no inline validation);
  page REGISTRY + COVERAGE (public row, login ✓) ticked; lessons run 16 appended. **NEXT page =
  `forgot-password`** (build the link's destination; needs the new backend `auth` routes + a MINOR auth bump —
  see Next action / D-PLAN). All this session's work committed via `git-version` next.
- **2026-06-29 (pm)** — **Phase 3 (`web`) STARTED — ported the web foundation scaffold + it builds green.**
  Backend feature coverage having closed (14 features), began the web phase. On "continue" the user chose
  **"scaffold + spec first page"** (vs provision-Vercel-first / spec-whole-auth-path-first). Mapped the
  legacy web foundation (`../rasifiters-webapp`: config + full `src/lib` + root `src/app` + `src/middleware`
  + components), then ported the **page-independent infrastructure directly** (NOT via `question-asker` —
  that loop is for pages; this mirrors the backend foundation port). Files into `apps/web`: 8 config files
  (`package.json` renamed `rasifiters-web` + dropped `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`; `tsconfig`, `next.config.mjs`,
  `postcss`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `next-env.d.ts`, `.npmrc`, `.gitignore`), all of `src/lib/*` (config,
  `api/{client,auth}`, `auth/{session,jwt,auth-provider}`, theme + theme-provider, storage, permissions,
  format, chart-theme, use-active-program, use-client-search-params, hooks/{use-auth-guard,use-is-mobile}),
  `src/app/{globals.css,layout,providers,shell,page}`, `src/components/icons`, brand assets. **4 deliberate
  deviations (all migration-justified, logged in `apps/web/CONTEXT.md` §Foundation port):** host
  Netlify→Vercel (dropped plugin+`netlify.toml`, default APP_URL→`rasifiters.com`); prod API default →
  `https://rasifiters-api.onrender.com/api` (our Render service); **`NotificationsGate` = deferred stub**
  (returns null — drags in the unported web notifications/SSE+programs stack otherwise; backend
  deferred-stub pattern, replaced when that feature lands); **`src/middleware.ts` faithfully ported but
  INERT + incompatible with Supabase ES256** (HS256/shared-secret verify → would reject every ES256 token;
  no protected routes exist yet; **open decision for the auth-path SPEC** — ES256/JWKS-at-edge vs
  decode+expiry-only — see Open questions). `npm install` (463 pkgs) + `npm run build` both ✓ (TS strict +
  lint + edge middleware + Manrope font all compile). PROGRESS + CONTEXT updated. **Then specced + ported the
  FIRST web page — `splash`** (the public welcome screen; `question-asker` run 15, the first page/screen
  spec). Public leaf page: typewriter intro + `BrandMark` logo + Sign-in CTA → `/login`, authenticated→
  `/programs` redirect; consumes only the foundation `useAuth` (no API). Tight 2-Q round — **D-S1** faithful
  1:1 + **D-REF** (`consumed_by=[web]`; the iOS `SplashView` divergence — placeholder icon + no redirect; web
  keeps the real logo, **iOS placeholder flagged as a defect** to fix at the iOS splash port). Role rules N/A
  (pre-auth). F1–F4 (web-only auth redirect; no loading gate / splash flash; iOS-placeholder defect;
  type-speed). Wrote `specs/pages/web/splash/SPEC.md` + ported `src/app/splash/page.tsx` +
  `src/components/BrandMark.tsx`; `npm run build` ✓ (`/splash` prerendered); page REGISTRY + COVERAGE (public
  row `[~]`, splash ✓) ticked; lessons run 15 appended. **All Phase-3 work this session (foundation + splash)
  is UNCOMMITTED** — commit via `git-version` next. Next page: **`login`** — where the real auth round-trip +
  the auth-path middleware (HS256→ES256) decision get exercised.
- **2026-06-29 (am-6)** — **Specced + ported `app-config` — the 14th and LAST backend feature; backend
  feature coverage is now COMPLETE.** First confirmed (per the carried Next-action) what remained of
  `app-config`/push: **nothing to port** — `GET /api/app-config` was already inline + byte-identical in
  `server.js`; the push/APNs device lifecycle (`PUT`/`DELETE /api/notifications/device`, `pushNotifications`
  util, APNs dispatch, `member_push_tokens` table, `APNS_*` env) landed with `notifications`;
  `upsert/removePushToken` + the login push-capture landed with `auth`. So this was a **documentation-only**
  SPEC to close `COVERAGE.md` L26. `question-asker`: fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS — **both
  app-config AND push are `consumed_by = [ios]` only** (iOS version-gate → force-update modal
  `ProgramContext+VersionCheck.swift`; iOS APNs token via login body + `PUT/DELETE /device`); **web consumes
  neither** (no `/api/app-config`, no device registration — it uses SSE for notifications). Tight 3-Q round:
  **D-C1** scope = **own app-config, reference push** (push is already documented in `notifications`/`auth`;
  §6 of the SPEC is a cross-reference index, not a re-doc — avoids the SSOT/duplication a re-doc would create)
  + **keep the route inline** in `server.js` (faithful — legacy is inline). **Stance = the user chose "change
  now"**; a scope-pinning follow-up locked exactly **2 cleanups** (3rd option — extract to a route file —
  unselected): **D-C2** add `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` (iOS polls the gate on every
  launch/foreground/widget-open) + **D-C3** trim + semver-validate `MIN_IOS_VERSION` via a new
  `normalizeMinIosVersion` (`^\d+(\.\d+)*$`, else `null`) so a malformed env yields no gate rather than a
  broken client comparison. Faithful otherwise; F1–F5 (`device_id` sent-but-always-nil by iOS; no logout
  `DELETE /device`; public no-auth route; operator-managed env not in `render.yaml`; web ignores both).
  **Applied the 2 changes to `server.js`** (`normalizeMinIosVersion` + Cache-Control). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0;
  registered in registry.json (`app-config`, `consumed_by:[ios]`, `depends_on:[]`) + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE
  (L26 ticked — **backend section fully covered**). Boot/syntax check (`node --check server.js` OK;
  `normalizeMinIosVersion` verified: trims, accepts `1.2.3`/`2`, rejects `v1.2`/`latest`/empty → `null`)
  passes. **Runtime smoke-test deferred to the batched pre-cutover pass.** Next phase: **`web`** (provision
  Vercel `rasifiters-web`, then page-by-page via `question-asker` page/screen specs).
- **2026-06-29 (am-5)** — **Specced + ported the `member-analytics` feature** (13th feature — the per-member
  analytics surface; **its own file pair**, not the analytics/analytics-v2 pair). `question-asker`: read the
  full legacy `routes/memberAnalytics.js` (4 routers) + `services/memberAnalyticsService.js` (4 fns + helpers)
  in full; confirmed all 6 models pre-ported + the WorkoutLog↔ProgramWorkout default-alias association; found
  the **one porting wrinkle** — the service imports `resolveTimelineWindow`/`buildBuckets`/`bucketKey` from
  `analyticsService`, which legacy exported but our v1/v2 port left un-exported (no consumer yet). Fanned 2
  `Explore` agents over web + iOS consumption — **they agree exactly:** all 4 endpoints live on BOTH clients
  1:1, **no divergence, no dead routes** (`member-recent` is the shared workout-history read — why workout-logs
  dropped its 2 GETs; metrics is dual-use leaderboard + member card on both). Noted this feature **enforces
  per-program read authz** (`ensureProgramAccess`) — the very thing v1/v2 flagged absent (their F2). 6 decisions:
  **D-C1** scope = its own file pair; **D-C2** (user chose faithful) **re-export the 3 timeline helpers from
  `analyticsService.js`** (restore the legacy export surface; single-sourced, not duplicated — `depends_on:
  analytics`); **D-C3 + D-C4** (user pinned both cleanups) **C1** extract the shared requester-access +
  target-enrolled prelude shared by history/streaks/recent into `assertMemberAccess` (400/403/404 statuses
  preserved 1:1; metrics keeps its own inline checks/distinct message) + **C2** guard a null
  `program.start_date` in `getMemberStreaks` (mirrors `getMemberMetrics`' guard; only the null-start_date 500
  edge changes); **D-REF** `[web, ios]` 4 routes 1:1; **D-S1** faithful verbatim otherwise — **no UTC cleanup**
  (dates already UTC-correct, `T00:00:00Z` + `getUTC*`, unlike v1). Flagged F1–F7 (per-program read authz
  enforced; `current` streak not anchored to today; in-memory metrics filter/sort/no-pagination; possibly-unused
  rich fields; null sleep/food coerced to 0; synthetic recent id; MTD-within-range/UTC). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0;
  registered in registry.json (`depends_on:[auth, analytics, members, programs, program-memberships,
  program-workouts, workout-logs, daily-health-logs]`) + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE. Then **ported**: re-added the
  3 helpers to `analyticsService.js`'s `module.exports` (D-C2), `services/memberAnalyticsService.js` (4 fns +
  helpers + `assertMemberAccess`, the start_date guard), `routes/memberAnalytics.js` (4 routers, verbatim),
  mounted the 4 `/api/member-*` routers in `server.js` (removed the placeholder comment). Boot check
  (analyticsService re-exports the 3 helpers, 4 service fns export, 4 routers each `GET /` =
  `[authenticateToken, handler]`, server loads; syntax clean) passes. **The D-C2 re-export touches the built
  `analytics` feature → patch bump at commit** (git-version detects analyticsService.js touched). **Runtime
  smoke-test deferred to the batched pre-cutover pass.** Next: `app-config`/push.
- **2026-06-29 (am-4)** — **Specced + ported the `analytics-v2` feature** (12th feature — the v2 half of the
  shared `routes/analytics.js`/`analyticsService.js` file pair; the file pair is now whole, like the logs +
  workout services). `question-asker`: read the full legacy v2 half of `analyticsService.js` (`getSummaryV2` +
  the 5 workout-type/participation fns, 471–692) + the `v2Router` route handlers (`analytics.js:124-195`) +
  the already-ported v1 service/routes (to confirm the shared helpers + utils + module-top imports are all
  present from v1 — they are). Verified the `Member.member_name` VIRTUAL exists. Fanned 2 `Explore` agents over
  web + iOS v2 consumption — **they agree exactly:** 5 of 6 v2 routes live on BOTH clients 1:1 (participation/mtd
  → summary MTD card; workouts/types/{total,most-popular,longest-duration,highest-participation} → the
  Lifestyle/Workout-Types tiles), and **`GET /summary` (v2) is dead on BOTH** — both call the v1 summary
  `/api/analytics/summary` instead. 4 decisions: **D-C1** scope = the v2 half appended to the shared files
  (reuse helpers/utils — no new files; `member-analytics` separate); **D-C2** (user chose drop) **drop the dead
  `GET /summary` (v2) + `getSummaryV2`** — the mirror of v1's D-C2 (each version dropped the half-route its
  clients abandoned); distinct-but-superseded (not a byte-dup: optional `programId`/global agg, `member_name`,
  no `program_progress`); it was also the only UTC-bucketing site in the v2 half, so **no UTC cleanup needed**;
  **D-REF** `[web, ios]` 5 routes 1:1, no divergence; **D-S1** faithful verbatim otherwise. Flagged F1–F6
  (**F1** `getParticipationMTDV2` byte-identical to the v1 `getParticipationMTD` v1 dropped — now the live
  participation card; **F4** `getHighestParticipationWorkoutType`'s member-scoped branch is dead, both clients
  call it program-wide; inherited F2/F5/F6 = no per-program read authz / MTD server-local boundaries /
  `COUNT('*')`+raw-`DISTINCT` idioms). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0; registered in registry.json
  (`depends_on:[auth, analytics, program-memberships, program-workouts, workout-logs]`) + REGISTRY.md +
  COVERAGE. Then **ported**: appended the 5 v2 fns to `services/analyticsService.js` (`getSummaryV2` omitted)
  + extended exports, appended the `v2Router` (5 routes, no `/summary`) to `routes/analytics.js` (now exports
  `{ v1Router, v2Router }`), mounted `/api/analytics-v2` in `server.js` (removed the placeholder comment). Boot
  check (v2 5-route stack no `/summary`, all `authenticateToken`, 5 service fns export + `getSummaryV2` absent,
  v1 8-route stack + fns unchanged, server loads) passes. **The analytics file pair is now whole.** **Runtime
  smoke-test deferred to the batched pre-cutover pass.** Next: `member-analytics`.
- **2026-06-29 (am-3)** — **Specced + ported the `analytics` (v1) feature** (11th feature — the program-level
  read-aggregation API; the `v1Router` half of the shared `routes/analytics.js`/`analyticsService.js`).
  `question-asker`: read the full v1 half of `analyticsService.js` (shared date/bucket helpers + 9 v1 fns,
  1–472) + the v1 route handlers + both analytics-only utils (`dateRange.js`, `queryHelpers.js`); confirmed
  the utils are used by no other service (analytics-only) and all 6 models are pre-ported. Fanned 2 `Explore`
  agents over web + iOS. **Findings:** 8 of 9 v1 endpoints live on BOTH clients 1:1 (summary, workouts/total,
  duration/total, duration/average, timeline, health/timeline, distribution/day, workouts/types); the 9th,
  **`participation/mtd` (v1), is dead on both** — both call the v2 variant (`/api/analytics-v2/participation/mtd`).
  No divergence. 6 decisions: **D-C1** scope = v1 half + the 2 utils (v2 = next feature, same file pair;
  member-analytics separate); **D-C2** (user chose drop) drop the dead `participation/mtd` v1 route +
  `getParticipationMTD`; **D-C3 + D-C4** (user chose both cleanups via a pinning multiSelect) UTC-fix the
  server-local-TZ date formatting — D-C3 the distribution weekday bucketing (`getDistributionByDay` +
  `getSummary.distribution_by_day`, numeric) + D-C4 the timeline labels (`bucketLabel`, display); both add
  `timeZone:"UTC"` (unchanged on Render-UTC, just deterministic); **D-REF** `[web, ios]` 8 routes 1:1;
  **D-S1** faithful verbatim otherwise (every aggregation query + bucketing + response shape ported exactly).
  Flagged F1–F7 (MTD-vs-`period` dual window; no per-program read authz; `resolveTimelineWindow` plain-`Error`
  →500; `buildMTDDateRanges`/`getPeriodRange` server-local boundaries — out of cleanup scope; `COUNT('*')`
  idiom). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0; registered in registry.json
  (`depends_on:[auth, members, programs, program-memberships, program-workouts, workout-logs, daily-health-logs]`)
  + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE. Then **ported**: `utils/dateRange.js` + `utils/queryHelpers.js` (verbatim),
  `services/analyticsService.js` (helpers + 8 v1 fns, the 2 UTC fixes; `getParticipationMTD` + v2 fns
  omitted), `routes/analytics.js` (`v1Router` 8 routes, exports `{ v1Router }`), mounted `/api/analytics`.
  Boot check (8-route stack no `participation/mtd`, all `authenticateToken`, 8 service fns export, both utils
  load, 4 `timeZone:"UTC"` fixes present, server loads) passes. **Runtime smoke-test deferred to the batched
  pre-cutover pass.** Next: `analytics-v2` (the other half).
- **2026-06-29 (am-2)** — **Specced + ported the `daily-health-logs` feature** (10th feature — the OTHER
  half of the shared `routes/logs.js`/`services/logService.js` file pair). `question-asker`: reused the
  full read of `logService.js` (daily-health half) + `routes/logs.js` from the workout-logs run; verified
  the `DailyHealthLog` model + associations are pre-ported (composite PK `program_id+member_id+log_date` =
  one row/day; `food_quality`→DB `diet_quality`). Fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS. **Cleaner than
  workout-logs:** all 4 routes (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE) live on BOTH clients, **no dead routes, no divergence,
  no batch route** (`consumed_by = [web, ios]`): web `lib/api/{logs,members}.ts` (log-health form + member
  health dashboard/detail), iOS `APIClient+Health.swift` + the quick-add health widget +
  `MemberHealthDetail`/`DailyHealthEditSheet`. 5 decisions: **D-C1** scope = daily-health half, append the
  4 fns + `parseOptionalNumber` to the file pair (helpers + `requireDataEntryAllowed` middleware already
  there from workout-logs — reused, not re-created); **D-C2** (user chose consistency) reuse `workout-logs`'
  `requireDataEntryAllowed` middleware on the 3 write routes so both halves enforce the lock identically
  (GET ungated; the write fns drop inline `assertDataEntryAllowed`; same accepted ordering nuance F4);
  **D-C3** tidy `updateDailyHealthLog`'s 3-arg `(parsed, requester, rawBody)` signature → single `(body,
  requester)` (legacy passed `req.body` twice; behavior identical — derive destructure + `hasOwnProperty`
  presence from one object); **D-REF** `[web, ios]` all 4 1:1; **D-S1** faithful otherwise. Flagged F1–F6
  (one-row-per-day PK + 409-on-dup; partial-update absent-vs-null; synthetic GET id; `food_quality↔diet_quality`;
  the 2 changed legacy shapes). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0; registered in registry.json
  (`depends_on:[auth, programs, program-memberships, workout-logs]`) + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE. Then
  **ported**: appended `parseOptionalNumber` + the 4 daily-health fns to `services/logService.js` (added
  `Op` + `DailyHealthLog` imports), the `dailyHealthLogRouter` (4 routes, lock on writes) to `routes/logs.js`
  (now exports both routers), mounted `/api/daily-health-logs` in `server.js`. Boot check (9 service fns
  export, daily POST/PUT/DELETE guarded + GET ungated, workout router unchanged, server loads) passes.
  **The logs file pair is now whole** (both halves reunited, like workoutService). **Runtime smoke-test
  deferred to the batched pre-cutover pass.** Next: `analytics` (aggregates both fact tables).
- **2026-06-29 (am)** — **Specced + ported the `workout-logs` feature** (9th feature — the workout-logging
  write surface, and the `workoutLogRouter` half of the shared `routes/logs.js`/`services/logService.js`).
  `question-asker`: read the legacy `routes/logs.js` + the workout-log half of `logService.js` + the
  `WorkoutLog` model in full, fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS consumption. **Key findings:** the
  file pair holds TWO COVERAGE rows (workout-logs + daily-health-logs — pre-drawn split, like workoutService);
  **both GET routes are called by NEITHER client** (`GET /` by date + `GET /member/:memberName` — web + iOS
  both read history via `/api/member-recent`); `POST /batch` is **web-only** (iOS bulk-logs by looping single
  `POST /` in its widget); the add/edit/delete trio is 1:1 across clients. Confirmed `req.user.role` is
  preserved 1:1 (legacy + new both set `role = global_role==='global_admin' ? 'admin' : 'member'`). 6
  decisions: **D-C1** scope = workout-log half + shared helpers; daily-health → next feature, same files
  reunited; **drop the 2 dead GETs**; **D-C2/D-C3/D-C4/D-C5** = the four user-chosen cleanups (the user
  selected ALL four via a scope-pinning multiSelect): positive-int single-log duration / collapse
  `addWorkoutLog`'s member-auth double-check / de-dup the membership lookups (incl. `deleteWorkoutLog`'s
  double `resolveLogPermissions`) / **hoist the `admin_only_data_entry` lock** out of the service into a
  co-located `requireDataEntryAllowed` **resolve-or-pass-through** middleware (403 + message preserved 1:1;
  one accepted ordering nuance — locked+non-admin+invalid-body → 403 before 400, F6; and delete's not-enrolled
  403 may precede a 404, F9). `resolveLogPermissions` stays inline (returns a boolean driving per-member
  branching — not a hoistable gate). **D-REF** `consumed_by = [web, ios]`. **D-S1** faithful otherwise.
  Flagged F1–F9 (dead GETs; single-add no-dup-handling PK-collision 500 vs batch summing; lazy
  `program_workouts` materialization; web-only batch; `member_id`-path skips member-exists; the 2 ordering
  nuances; + the 3 legacy shapes the cleanups changed). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0; registered in registry.json
  (`depends_on:[auth, members, programs, program-memberships, workouts, program-workouts]`) + REGISTRY.md +
  COVERAGE. Then **ported**: `services/logService.js` (4 live fns + shared helpers, cleanups applied; 2 GET
  fns + `parseOptionalNumber`/`assertDataEntryAllowed` omitted — daily-health adds them later),
  `routes/logs.js` (`workoutLogRouter` 4 routes + the middleware; exports `{ workoutLogRouter }` only),
  mounted `/api/workout-logs`. Boot check (4-route stack, no GET, every route =
  `[authenticateToken, requireDataEntryAllowed, handler]`, 5 service fns export, server loads) passes.
  **Runtime smoke-test deferred to the batched pre-cutover pass.** Next: `daily-health-logs` (the other half
  of the file pair).
- **2026-06-28 (pm-15)** — **Specced + ported the `program-workouts` feature** (8th feature — the
  program-scoped other half of the shared `workoutService.js`). `question-asker`: read the legacy
  `routes/programWorkouts.js` + the program-scoped half of `services/workoutService.js` + the `ProgramWorkout`
  model in full, fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS consumption. **Both clients call all 6 routes 1:1,
  no divergence** (`consumed_by = [web, ios]`): web's `lifestyle/workouts/page.tsx` (Workout Types mgmt) +
  iOS's `WorkoutTypesSection.swift` (`ViewWorkoutTypesListView`) drive the toggles + custom CRUD; `GET` is
  also read by the log forms (`LogWorkoutForm`/`BulkLogWorkoutForm`, which filter `is_hidden` client-side),
  the program dashboard, member-workout filters, and the iOS quick-add widget. 4 decisions: **D-C1** scope =
  the 6 program-scoped routes + fns split from `workoutService.js` (library half already → `workouts`);
  **D-C2** (the one change — user chose it) **hoist the per-action admin authz out of the service into a
  route guard** — a local **resolve-or-pass-through `requireProgramAdmin(resolveProgramId)`** factory whose
  per-route resolvers mirror each legacy fn's pre-admin-check guards, so 403 fires exactly where legacy's
  inline check did and the service still emits its native 400/404 first (status codes 1:1, CLAUDE.md
  non-breaking); `GET` stays ungated; **D-REF** `[web, ios]`, no divergence; **D-S1** faithful otherwise.
  Flagged F1–F7 (dual-meaning GET id `pw?.id || gw.id`; hidden rows included; lazy `program_workouts`
  materialization on first hide; the friendly in-use delete 400 vs the library's bare destroy; add/edit
  dedup vs program+global; unscoped `GET` read). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0 (no migration delta — models + schema
  pre-ported); registered in registry.json (`depends_on:[auth, workouts, program-memberships, programs]`) +
  REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE. Then **ported**: appended the 6 program-scoped fns to `services/workoutService.js`
  (inline admin checks removed, `requester` param dropped), `routes/programWorkouts.js` (6 routes + the guard
  factory), mounted `/api/program-workouts`. Boot check (6-route stack w/ correct ordering, `GET` ungated vs
  curation routes guarded, all 10 service fns export, server loads) passes. **Pending:** runtime smoke-test
  (Render auto-deploy on push). Next: `workout-logs` (consumes the `program_workouts` join target).
- **2026-06-28 (pm-14)** — **Specced + ported the `workouts` feature** (7th feature — the global workout
  library). `question-asker`: read the legacy `routes/workouts.js` + `services/workoutService.js` + `Workout`
  model in full, fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS consumption. **Decisive reframe:** web calls
  **none** of the 5 `/api/workouts` routes (its `fetchWorkouts` wrapper is defined-but-dead), and iOS calls
  **only `GET`** (the "Add Workout" picker reference). So the admin CRUD (`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`) is called by
  **neither client**, and `POST /mobile` is a byte-identical dup of `POST /`. 4 decisions: **D-C1** scope =
  the global library only (the program-scoped half of the shared `workoutService.js` → the next
  `program-workouts` feature, per COVERAGE lines 18 vs 19); **D-C2** (the one change) **drop the dead
  byte-dup `POST /mobile`**; **D-REF** `consumed_by = [ios]` (GET-only live), flag web's dead `fetchWorkouts`
  + the unused admin CRUD; **D-S1** faithful otherwise — **keep the bare unguarded `deleteWorkout`** (the
  un-cascaded `program_workouts.library_workout_id` FK → 500 when in use, flagged F2) + the no-dedup-precheck
  create (unique-500, F5). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0 (no migration delta — model + schema already ported); registered
  in registry.json (`depends_on:[auth]`) + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE. Then **ported**: `services/workoutService.js`
  (library half only — 4 fns), `routes/workouts.js` (4 routes, no `/mobile`), mounted `/api/workouts`. Boot
  check (4 fns, 4 routes, `/mobile` absent, server loads) passes. Also fixed COVERAGE's stale members line
  (cascade now wired v0.2.0). **Pending:** runtime smoke-test (Render auto-deploy on push). Next:
  `program-workouts` (the other half of the split service).
- **2026-06-28 (pm-13)** — **Wired the two deferred 501 delete cascades** (`members DELETE /:id` + auth
  `DELETE /account`) now that program-memberships/invites/notifications are ported. Read both legacy bodies
  (`memberService.deleteMember` + `authService.deleteAccount`) — they are byte-identical — so **single-sourced**
  the cascade as `utils/programMemberships.cascadeMemberDeletion` (the util that already owns
  `handleMemberExit`): destroy outbound `program_invites` (by `invited_by`/`invited_username`/`invited_email ∈
  member emails`) + `notifications` where `actor_member_id = member.id`, run `handleMemberExit` (`updateCreatedBy:true`,
  `includeExitingMemberInRecipients:false`, `notificationActorId:null`) for every active membership + created
  program, emit `program.member_left` to remaining members, destroy the member. Each caller keeps its own
  transaction + global-admin guard + 404 + success message; the **migration delta** is best-effort
  `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.deleteUser(auth_user_id)` **after commit** (an orphaned `auth.users` row maps to
  no member → safe ordering). Updated both SPECs (route table, §4 prose, D-C1, F1, changelog) + bumped
  0.1.0→0.2.0; fixed the auth SPEC status (was "not yet deployed" → 🚀). Boot check (services + routes load,
  `cascadeMemberDeletion` exported, no circular dep) passes. **Pending:** runtime smoke-test (Render
  auto-deploy on push). Next: spec + port `workouts`/`program-workouts` → logs → analytics.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-12)** — **Specced + ported the `invites` feature** (6th feature — the co-mounted other
  half of `/api/program-memberships`). `question-asker`: read the legacy `routes/invites.js` +
  `inviteService.js` + the 2 models in full, fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS. `consumed_by =
  [web, ios]` — **all 4 routes 1:1 across clients, no divergence** (web `lib/api/{invites,members}.ts` +
  `/members/invite` + `/programs` modal; iOS `APIClient+Invites.swift` + `InvitesTabView` + `InviteMemberView`;
  matching DTOs). 6 decisions: **D-C1** scope = the 4 routes + `inviteService` + the `ProgramInvite`/
  `ProgramInviteBlock` tables, accept-path `ProgramMembership` write stays **inline** (faithful); **D-C2** the
  `program.invite_received`/`program.member_joined` emits wired **LIVE** (no stub — the keystone is ported);
  **D-C3a** drop the vestigial `target_member_id` (sent by neither client, read by no path); **D-C3b** fix
  `getAllInvites`' N+1 (one batched `Member.findAll` + map vs `Promise.all(findOne)` per invite); **D-REF**
  `[web, ios]` gates match; **D-S1** faithful otherwise. Flagged F1–F7 (privacy-safe `sendInvite` swallows
  throws to 200; global-admin accept-on-behalf+revoke; web's *second* accept path via `updateMembership`;
  `member_name` VIRTUAL dep; unused `invited_email`; hardcoded 30-day expiry/`max_uses:1`). Wrote SPEC v0.1.0;
  updated registry.json + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE. Then **ported**: `services/inviteService.js` (4 fns, the two
  cleanups, live emits via the ported `utils/notifications`), `routes/invites.js` (4 routes, faithful), mounted
  `inviteRoutes` at `/api/program-memberships` in `server.js` (alongside `membershipRoutes`). Boot check
  (4-route stack, emit engine wired, `InvitedByMember` assoc, server loads) passes. **The keystone realized:**
  first feature with **live** emits — the deferred-stub seam (programs/program-memberships) isn't needed.
  **Pending:** runtime smoke-test (Render auto-deploy on push). Next: wire the two 501 delete cascades to
  `handleMemberExit`, or port `workouts`.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-11)** — **Specced + ported the `notifications` feature** (5th feature — **the keystone**).
  `question-asker`: read the legacy `routes/notifications.js` + `utils/{notifications,notificationStreams,
  pushNotifications}.js` + the 3 models in full, fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS consumption.
  `consumed_by = [web, ios]`: **both** clients open the SSE stream (web `EventSource` `?token=`
  `NotificationsGate.tsx:144`; iOS `NotificationStreamClient.swift:12`) + call `GET /unacknowledged` +
  `POST /:id/acknowledge` + render a single-notification modal queue; **iOS-only** the APNs device lifecycle
  (`PUT/DELETE /device`); **`POST /broadcast` called by neither client** (vestigial, F1). 4 decisions (all the
  faithful lead): **D-C1** scope = the module only (replaces the deferred stub; cross-feature emits/cascades
  stay their features' follow-ups); **D-C2** (the one migration delta) the SSE stream auth swaps symmetric
  `jwt.verify(JWT_SECRET)` → Supabase JWKS verify (`verifySupabaseJwt` + `sub`→member), keeping the `?token=`
  query path for `EventSource`; **D-C4** defer APNs creds (`getProvider()→null` ⇒ push no-ops, SSE+DB live);
  **D-S1** faithful, keep broadcast vestigial. Wrote SPEC v0.1.0; updated registry.json + REGISTRY.md +
  COVERAGE. Then **ported**: **replaced** `utils/notifications.js` (DEFERRED STUB → real `createNotification`
  DB write + transactional `afterCommit` SSE/APNs dispatch + `getMemberIdsWithPushTokens`), added
  `utils/notificationStreams.js` (SSE registry) + `utils/pushNotifications.js` (APNs, `apn@^2.2.0`,
  graceful-null), refactored `middleware/auth.js` to share `resolveReqUser` between `authenticateToken` +
  the new `authenticateStream` (D-C2), `routes/notifications.js` (6 routes), mounted `/api/notifications`,
  added `APNS_*` `sync:false` to `render.yaml`. `npm install` + syntax + boot check (6-route stack,
  `authenticateStream` exported, `getProvider()→null`) pass. **Key unblock:** the deferred emits across
  programs/program-memberships now fire **unchanged** (the stub is gone). **Pending:** runtime smoke-test
  (Render auto-deploy on push). Next: `invites` (the co-mounted membership half) or wire the two 501 delete
  cascades to `handleMemberExit`.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-10)** — **Specced + ported the `program-memberships` feature** (4th feature). `question-asker`:
  read `routes/memberships.js` + `membershipService.js` + `utils/programMemberships.js` (`handleMemberExit`) +
  the model in full, fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web + iOS. `consumed_by = [web, ios]`; gates match across
  clients (no divergence). Decisions: **D-C1** scope = the 6 membership routes + `handleMemberExit`; the
  co-mounted invite routes (`server.js:50`) → the separate `invites` feature; **D-C2** (change) fix
  `createMemberAndEnroll` → loginable (Supabase `createUser` + require `email`, mirroring members D-C2) — same
  latent password bug; **D-C3** (change) drop the 2 dead routes `GET /available` + `POST /enroll` (called by
  neither client — iOS methods dormant, web absent); **D-C4** defer the notification emits (role_changed/
  member_removed/member_left + the cascade emits) via a **deferred stub** `utils/notifications.js` (real
  `getActiveProgramMemberIds`, no-op `createNotification`). Stance "change/clean up" pinned by a scope follow-up
  to exactly D-C2 + D-C3. Flagged F1–F7 (handleMemberExit's caller-specific params for the deferred members/auth
  cascades; self-service status matrix; last-admin guard; the cross-feature invite-table writes ported since the
  models exist). Wrote the SPEC v0.1.0; updated registry.json + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE. Then **ported**:
  `utils/notifications.js` (stub), `utils/programMemberships.js` (faithful cascade), `services/membershipService.js`
  (6 fns, createMemberAndEnroll fixed), `routes/memberships.js` (6 routes), mounted `/api/program-memberships`.
  Boot check (6 service fns + handleMemberExit + 6-route stack + 6 models) passes. **Key unblock:** porting
  `handleMemberExit` here gives the deferred members `DELETE /:id` + auth `/account` their cascade dependency —
  wiring those is the members/auth follow-up. **Pending:** runtime smoke-test (Render auto-deploy on push).
  Next: `notifications` (replaces the stub + unblocks every deferred emit).
- **2026-06-28 (pm-9)** — **Specced + ported the `programs` feature** (3rd feature). `question-asker`: read
  the legacy `routes/programs.js` + `services/programService.js` + `Program` model in full, fanned 2
  `Explore` agents over web + iOS consumption (`consumed_by = [web, ios]`, all four routes). Decisions:
  **D-C1** the `program.updated`/`program.deleted` notification emit is **deferred** (it drags in SSE streams
  + APNs push = the undocumented `notifications` feature) → guarded `emitProgramNotification` no-op, CRUD
  ports fully functional (a side-effect deferral, vs the members whole-route 501); **D-C2** (the one
  deliberate change, user chose clean-up) `createProgram` **drops the vestigial `description` field** — sent
  by neither client, unupdatable, never returned (the create-field analog of members' dead routes), with a
  scope-pinning follow-up confirming drop-only; **D-S2** `getPrograms` keeps both raw `sequelize.query`
  branches verbatim; **D-REF** `admin_only_data_entry` is web-only (web edit-page toggle; iOS `ProgramDTO`
  never decodes/sets it) — backend serves/accepts it for both faithfully. Flagged F1–F7 (incl. always-equal
  total/active counts, decoded-but-never-served `enrollments_closed`). Wrote `specs/features/programs/SPEC.md`
  v0.1.0; updated registry.json + REGISTRY.md + COVERAGE (`[~]`). Then **ported**: `services/programService.js`
  (faithful raw-SQL list, create w/o description, update/soft-delete with deferred emit), `routes/programs.js`
  (faithful 1:1), mounted `/api/programs` in `server.js`. Boot check (4 service fns + GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
  route stack + models resolve) passes. **Pending:** runtime smoke-test vs live Supabase (the Render
  auto-deploy on push). Next: `program-memberships` (owns the `ProgramMembership` join + the deferred
  cascades).
- **2026-06-28 (pm-8)** — **Specced + ported the `members` feature** (2nd feature). `question-asker`: read
  the legacy `routes/members.js` + `services/memberService.js` in full, fanned 2 `Explore` agents over web +
  iOS consumption. Key finding — **`POST`/`DELETE /api/members` are called by neither client** (both use
  `/auth/register` + `/program-memberships`), reframing it as read + self-profile-update with two vestigial
  admin routes. User chose to **fix** the latent bug in `createMember` (legacy destructured `password` but
  never persisted it → unloggable member): D-C2 wires it to Supabase `admin.createUser` + requires `email`.
  Wrote `specs/features/members/SPEC.md` v0.1.0 (D-C1/D-C2/D-REF/D-S1, F1–F6); committed
  (`docs(members)` + `chore(skills)`) + tagged `feature/members@v0.1.0` + pushed. Then **ported**:
  `services/memberService.js` (faithful reads/update; `createMember` change reusing
  `authService.validatePassword`/`normalizeEmail`; `getAllMembers` excludes `auth_user_id`;
  `deleteMember`→501 per D-C1), `routes/members.js` (faithful 1:1), mounted `/api/members` in `server.js`.
  Boot check (module load + 5-route stack) passes. Status 📄→🏗️. **Pending:** runtime smoke-test vs live
  Supabase (the auto-deploy to Render on push). Next: the remaining backend features.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-7)** — **Deployed the auth backend to Render + verified it live.** User provisioned the
  Blueprint (`apps/backend/render.yaml`) and connected GitHub auto-deploy; service `rasifiters-api`
  (`srv-d90tgmv7f7vs73cudptg`) live at `https://rasifiters-api.onrender.com`. Smoke test: `GET /`→200
  (DB connected), `/api/app-config`+`/api/test`→200, guarded route no-token→401, bogus login→401. Full

  a migration gap:** placeholder (no-email) members had no `member_emails` row → `admin` 401'd before the
  password check; shipped `apps/backend/sql/002_backfill_placeholder_member_emails.sql` (user ran it) +
  patched `tools/migrator/src/importAuth.js` (writes the placeholder row on create/link/re-run). Recorded
  the deploy: `CONTEXT.md` + `apps/backend/CONTEXT.md` (URL + service id), filled the
  `deploy-scope-guard.sh` allow-list (+ a real render-srv guard, tested), flipped `auth` 🏗️→🚀 in
  registry/REGISTRY/SPEC §12. Next: spec + port the remaining backend features.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-6)** — **Switched the backend host Railway → Render** (user decision; METHODOLOGY R7).
  Researched Render's mechanics (Blueprint spec, monorepo `rootDir`+`buildFilter`, env-var model, hosted
  MCP, health checks, PORT/host). Authored **`apps/backend/render.yaml`** (Blueprint: `type: web`,
  `rootDir: apps/backend`, `npm ci`/`npm start`, `healthCheckPath: /`, `autoDeployTrigger: commit`,
  `buildFilter.paths: [apps/backend/**]`; non-secret vars inline, the 3 secrets as `sync: false`).
  `server.js` now binds `0.0.0.0` (Render injects `PORT`, default 10000). Swept every Railway reference →
  Render across the repo: `.mcp.json` (`railway`→`render` MCP `https://mcp.render.com/mcp`),
  `.env.mcp.example`, the `deploy-scope-guard.sh` hook, the **`deploy` skill** (prereqs, workflow §2,
  git→deploy pipeline §B, smoke test, converged lessons, frontmatter), `ENV_RUNBOOK.md` (§1/§2 Render
  inspect+change mechanics, §3/§6 host delta), `METHODOLOGY.md` (R4 amended + new **R7**), `ICM.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `SETUP.md`, `README.md`, `apps/{web,backend}/CONTEXT.md`, the `supabase` +
  `health-check` skills, the auth SPEC changelog, `package.json`. Also **verified the asymmetric Supabase
  JWT keys are already live** (JWKS serves an ES256/P-256 key) — that open blocker is resolved. NOT
  committed yet (use `git-version`). Next: provision the Render Blueprint + deploy (needs the user's
  `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`), then smoke-test the auth path.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-5)** — **Ported the backend foundation + `auth` feature** into `apps/backend/`. Data
  layer (faithful 1:1 via a subagent): `config/database.js` (`DB_URL`→`DATABASE_URL`, kept
  `rejectUnauthorized:false` per F6), 13 models + `models/index.js` with the R1 deltas
  (`Member.auth_user_id` added; `member_credentials`/`refresh_tokens` models + associations dropped),
  `utils/response.js`, `middleware/errorHandler.js`. Auth slice (hand-written per SPEC §7):
  `config/supabase.js` (anon + service clients + `verifySupabaseJwt` via jose JWKS), `middleware/auth.js`
  (Supabase-JWT verify + `sub`→`auth_user_id` member lookup rebuilding the legacy `req.user`; authz gates
  unchanged), `services/authService.js` (proxy login/refresh/logout via Supabase, register/change-password
  via admin API; `/account` deferred → 501), `routes/auth.js` (faithful), `server.js` (mounts only
  `/api/auth`). `package.json` drops `jsonwebtoken`/`bcrypt`, adds `@supabase/supabase-js`+`jose`+`uuid`.
  `npm install` + boot-check pass (syntax, module load, models wired, jose JWKS wire reached). Next:
  Railway deploy (needs asymmetric Supabase JWT keys + env) and the remaining backend features.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-4)** — **Specced the backend `auth` feature** (first SPEC in the repo) via
  `question-asker`. 3 parallel Explore agents mapped the legacy auth (route+service · middleware+authz ·
  models+config); re-read `authService.js`/`middleware/auth.js`/`routes/auth.js` in full to verify every
  `file:line`. 4 decisions confirmed (all faithful): **D-C1** scope = whole `middleware/auth.js` module
  (authN + authZ gates) as one unit; **D-C2** verify Supabase JWTs via **JWKS (ES256) + per-request
  `sub`→`members.auth_user_id` lookup** to rebuild `req.user` (deliberate change from legacy's
  lookup-free token); **D-C3** clients unchanged, `consumed_by=[web,ios]`, login proxies Supabase sign-in
  via username→primary-email resolution, refresh/logout proxy Supabase, `refresh_tokens` retires;
  **D-S1** faithful 1:1 (flagged F1–F7: dual payloads, no rate-limit, unused auth_identities/
  email_verification_tokens, rejectUnauthorized:false, two JWT verifiers, vestigial `userId`). Wrote
  `specs/features/auth/SPEC.md` v0.1.0; updated REGISTRY.md + registry.json + COVERAGE (auth ticked `[x]`).
  Not committed yet (use `git-version`). Next: port the backend per §7.
- **2026-06-28 (pm-3)** — **Ran the migration against live Supabase.** User applied
  `apps/backend/sql/001_schema.sql` + reset the DB password + handed over creds; filled
  `tools/migrator/.env`. Dry-run → `npm run migrate`: all 13 tables copied + reconciled vs legacy, **48
  `auth.users` created (bcrypt imported) and 48/48 members linked**, admin on the placeholder email
  (confirmed via `auth.users` join). Idempotency re-run = 48 skips, `auth.users` still 48. Migration done;
  next is Phase 2 (backend). Fixed two migrator bugs found while wiring it (auth/verify modes need the
  legacy DSN; added `sslmode=disable` escape hatch).
- **2026-06-28 (pm-2)** — **Built the migrator + faithful schema.** Mapped the live legacy schema via
  `pg_dump --schema-only` (richer than the Sequelize models: real CHECKs, `programs.created_by NOT NULL`,
  composite FKs, partial unique index; found `auth_identities`/`email_verification_tokens` empty +
  `legacy_*` cruft). Wrote `apps/backend/sql/001_schema.sql` (13 canonical tables, idempotent
  `IF NOT EXISTS`, the `members.auth_user_id`→`auth.users` delta; retired
  member_credentials/refresh_tokens/auth_identities/email_verification_tokens) and `tools/migrator/` (Node:
  generic FK-ordered upsert copy + bcrypt→Supabase-Auth import + backfill + reconciliation report).
  Resolved the no-email question → placeholder for `admin`. **Validated locally** against the real Render
  data into a throwaway Postgres: schema applies + is idempotent; all 13 tables row-count match
  (members 48 … notification_recipients 1304); auth dry-run = 48/48 with bcrypt hash, 1 placeholder.
  Awaits the user to apply the schema + run against Supabase.
- **2026-06-28 (pm)** — **Provisioned Supabase.** Created a new org `RaSi Fiters` (`lxehyprifvuozciizlem`)
  + project `rasifiters` (ref `kpadxjekpiwfkqcxtrio`, `us-east-1`, ACTIVE_HEALTHY) via the Supabase CLI
  (upgraded 2.67→2.108 to fix the broken `--region` enum; trusted the `supabase/tap`). DB password generated
  with `openssl rand -hex 24`; captured all keys (anon/service_role + new publishable/secret) + the three
  DATABASE_URL forms (direct IPv6 / session-pooler `aws-1-us-east-1` :5432 / txn-pooler :6543, all verified
  with `psql select`) into the gitignored scratchpad secrets file for the user's password manager. Repointed
  `.mcp.json` `supabase-rasifiters` to the real ref; updated `ICM.md` + `CONTEXT.md`. Railway/Vercel
  deferred (no app code yet). Next: build `tools/migrator/`.
- **2026-06-28** — Scaffolded the ICM repo from higgins-master; then restructured to fit RaSi: dropped
  `companies/` → `apps/`; split specs into `specs/features/` + `specs/pages/` (with role-based view rules);
  removed the `stitch` skill (faithful direct port instead); repurposed `audit` as a web↔iOS parity check;
  dropped per-feature version folders; made features client-specific-capable; added this `PROGRESS.md`.
