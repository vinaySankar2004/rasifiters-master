## Run history (newest first)

- **2026-07-01** — **Merged the two Summary workout-add entry points into one multi-row "Add workouts" form (web + iOS).** Removed the single "Add workout" + admin-only "Bulk add" cards/forms; the unified multi-row form now posts to `POST /workout-logs/batch` for everyone — **`workout-logs` D-C8** relaxes batch auth so a plain member may batch-log **their own** rows (member column hidden, each row seeded to self); admin/logger keep the per-row member picker. All-or-nothing duplicate rejection unchanged; widgets untouched. Deleted `LogWorkoutForm`/`BulkLogWorkoutForm` → `LogWorkoutsForm` (web); `AddWorkoutDetailView`/`BulkAddWorkoutDetailView` → `AddWorkoutsDetailView` (iOS). `tsc` ✓, iOS `BuildProject` ✓ (0 errors). SPECs: `workout-logs`→0.3.0 (D-C8), web `summary`→0.2.0, iOS `log-workout`→0.2.0.
- **2026-06-30 (run 65)** — **Ported the 2 iOS widget entry views → the iOS DEFERRED LAYER IS CLOSED.** `question-asker` on the last 2 deferred stubs (`QuickAddWorkout`/`QuickAddHealthWidgetEntryView`, the Home-Screen widget deep-link targets).
- **2026-06-30** — **Web polish + live-test fixes (post-launch side-quests; web surface stays CLOSED → next is `ios`).** Three user-reported fixes against the LIVE site, all committed + deployed + manually verified by the user: **(1) Profile page (`/program/profile`) gender fix + net-new email change** (commit `e4712d5`; **members→0.3.0**, **auth→0.5.0**,…
- **2026-06-29 (pm-10)** — **Specced + ported the `program` page (10th web page) — the FOURTH & LAST WORKSPACE TAB (`/program`), the program settings hub. All 4 workspace tabs now live; the landing layer is complete.** `question-asker` run 24.
- **2026-06-29 (pm-9)** — **Specced + ported the `lifestyle` page (9th web page) — the THIRD WORKSPACE TAB (`/lifestyle`), the workout-type-analytics / health-timeline overview.** `question-asker` run 23.
- **2026-06-29 (pm-8)** — **Specced + ported the `members` page (8th web page) — the SECOND WORKSPACE TAB (`/members`), the per-member overview / "view as" dashboard.** `question-asker` run 22.
- **2026-06-29 (pm-7)** — **Specced + ported the `summary` page (7th web page) — the FIRST WORKSPACE TAB (`/summary`), the program-overview dashboard + the desktop log-form write path.** `question-asker` run 21.

- **2026-06-29 (pm-5)** — **Specced + ported the `create-account` page (5th web page) — the public/auth path (splash → login → forgot → reset → create-account) is now COMPLETE.** `question-asker` run 19.
- **2026-06-29 (pm-4)** — **Specced + ported the `reset-password` page (4th web page, 2nd net-new) + the NET-NEW backend `POST /auth/reset-password` (auth 0.3.0→0.4.0); the auth-recovery path is now END-TO-END.** `question-asker` run 18.
- **2026-06-29 (pm-3)** — **Specced + ported the `forgot-password` page (3rd web page, the FIRST net-new one) + the NET-NEW backend `POST /auth/forgot-password` (auth 0.2.0→0.3.0).** `question-asker` run 17.
- **2026-06-29 (pm-2)** — **Specced + ported the `login` page (2nd web page spec) + established the auth-recovery path plan.** User opened by mandating the auth follow-up set: Supabase Auth was chosen for easy self-service recovery, so login/sign-up/account pages must GAIN forgot/reset-password (web first, then iOS), with a **dual** forgot-password (emailed rese…
- **2026-06-29 (pm)** — **Phase 3 (`web`) STARTED — ported the web foundation scaffold + it builds green.** Backend feature coverage having closed (14 features), began the web phase.
- **2026-06-29 (am-6)** — **Specced + ported `app-config` — the 14th and LAST backend feature; backend feature coverage is now COMPLETE.** First confirmed (per the carried Next-action) what remained of `app-config`/push: **nothing to port** — `GET /api/app-config` was already inline + byte-identical in `server.js`; the push/APNs device lifecycle (`PUT`/`DELETE /api/notifica…
- **2026-06-29 (am-5)** — **Specced + ported the `member-analytics` feature.** (13th feature — the per-member analytics surface; **its own file pair**, not the analytics/analytics-v2 pair).

- **2026-06-28 (pm-2)** — **Built the migrator + faithful schema.** Mapped the live legacy schema via `pg_dump --schema-only` (richer than the Sequelize models: real CHECKs, `programs.created_by NOT NULL`, composite FKs, partial unique index; found `auth_identities`/`email_verification_tokens` empty + `l…
- **2026-06-28 (pm)** — **Provisioned Supabase.** Created a new org `RaSi Fiters` (`lxehyprifvuozciizlem`) + project `rasifiters` (ref `kpadxjekpiwfkqcxtrio`, `us-east-1`, ACTIVE_HEALTHY) via the Supabase CLI (upgraded 2.67→2.108 to fix the broken `--region` enum; trusted the `supabase/…
- **2026-06-28** — Scaffolded the ICM repo from higgins-master; then restructured to fit RaSi: dropped `companies/` → `apps/`; split specs into `specs/features/` + `specs/pages/` (with role-based view rules); removed the `stitch` skill (faithful direct por…
