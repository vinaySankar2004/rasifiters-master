# Reliability overhaul — rolling handoff

> **Volatile — current state only.** Overwrite "Now" + "Next action" at every milestone. When resuming after
> a compaction or in a new session, read `PROGRESS.md` → [`BRIEF.md`](BRIEF.md) → this file, then continue.
> Durable outcomes move to their canonical homes (SPEC §9 D-rules, `METHODOLOGY.md` R-entries); the session
> log below is one line per session.

## Now

- **Phase:** not started — scoping complete (2026-10-10).
- **In flight:** nothing.
- **Blocked on the user:** nothing — all four tokens are present and verified (2026-10-10). Optional prep: Pixel
  USB debugging (below).
- **Step 0 leftovers (do first in Session 1):** (1) build the ask-guardrail hook for `SUPABASE_ADMIN_TOKEN` —
  **until it exists, don't use the admin token at all**; (2) wire MCP header auth / CLI fallbacks + docs;
  (3) Supabase moved its logs API: `…/analytics/endpoints/logs.all` now returns **410**; the replacement
  `GET /v1/projects/{ref}/analytics/endpoints/logs` answers, but `auth_logs` "does not exist" there — find the
  new source/table names (Supabase changelog #48235) before auth-log queries work.

## Next action

Session 1 → **Step 0** (credentials) → **Phase 0** (parallel discovery W1–W7) → walk the user through the
findings one workstream at a time → **Phase 1** design board. Use the kickoff prompt below.

**Before Session 1 (user):** put these in `.claude/settings.local.json` under `env` (gitignored — never in
chat, never committed):

| Key | Where to create it | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `RENDER_API_KEY` | dashboard.render.com → Account Settings → API Keys | ✅ present, worked 2026-10-10 |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | vercel.com/account/settings/tokens → Create | ✅ present, verified 2026-10-10 — scoped to the `rasifiters` project only (reads project `prj_Eqd5…` via team `personal-vinayak`; sees no teams) |
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens → Generate new token — **Project** scope `rasifiters`, **read-only** preset. The default for all reads (metrics, logs, settings, advisors), no prompts | ✅ present, verified 2026-10-10 — reads the project + Auth config |
| `SUPABASE_ADMIN_TOKEN` | same page — **Project** scope `rasifiters`, **Full access**. Deliberate changes only; every use prompts the user (hook built in Step 0) | ✅ present, valid (one read-only GET 2026-10-10); unused until the guardrail hook exists |

**Also before Session 1 (user):** on the Pixel, enable Developer options → **USB debugging**, and keep it
plugged into the Mac during the session, so W5 can read the real Google sign-in error with `adb logcat`
(and W2/W4 can watch FCM + Health Connect behaviour) instead of guessing.

Verify any token without printing it: read it from the file inside the command and pipe the header to curl
(`printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s' "$T" | curl -s -H @- <url>`), and print only non-secret fields.

## Workstream status

| # | Workstream | Discovery | Design | Build | Shipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | Sessions / auth | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| W2 | Push + invites | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| W3 | iOS health sync | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| W4 | Android health sync | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| W5 | Android Google sign-in | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| W6 | Observability + perf | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| W7 | Frontend state / error / design consistency | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

## Session log

- **2026-10-10** — Scoping. Evaluated an AWS move → shelved, stack stays (R8). Reviewed 30 days of Render
  metrics + Supabase usage (healthy core; 401 ≈ 22%, 409 noise, no request logs). Found first suspects S1–S9
  in code. User decisions: Supabase Pro, staging via the same project (staging tables), Step 0 = token-based
  access for all three services. Created `BRIEF.md` + this file. Same day: user created all tokens (Vercel
  project-scoped; Supabase read-only default + full-access admin) — all verified; read Supabase Auth session
  settings (BRIEF S8); Android Google sign-in failure confirmed on the Play build.

## Kickoff prompt — Session 1

```text
Session 1 of the RaSi Fiters reliability overhaul. You are the orchestrator.

Read first: PROGRESS.md, then specs/initiatives/reliability-overhaul/BRIEF.md and HANDOFF.md.

Role: orchestrate. Spin up agents (Explore, scout, planner, the adversaries) and workflows in parallel,
keep your own context lean, and verify agent claims against the code before they reach me or the board.
No app code changes this session until I approve the design board.

1. Step 0 — credentials, no OAuth. My tokens are in .claude/settings.local.json (RENDER_API_KEY,
   VERCEL_TOKEN, SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN = read-only, SUPABASE_ADMIN_TOKEN = full access). Wire
   token-based access for Render, Vercel and Supabase: test whether each hosted MCP accepts a Bearer
   header, otherwise use the CLI/REST with the token. Prove each with a read-only call (Render logs,
   Vercel logs, Supabase Auth settings + logs via the Management API). Build the guardrail: any command
   using SUPABASE_ADMIN_TOKEN must ask me first (BRIEF §6). Update CLAUDE.md, .mcp.json,
   .env.mcp.example and the hooks. Commit + push.
2. Phase 0 — discovery. Launch parallel read-only agents for W1–W7 (BRIEF §7). Each returns an evidence
   brief: how it works today (file:line), failure modes, which suspects S1–S9 are confirmed or refuted,
   and what the industry-standard version looks like. Pull production evidence now that we have access.
3. Walk me through the findings one workstream at a time and let me ask questions. Don't jump to
   solutions before I understand the current state.
4. Phase 1 — build the design board as an artifact: per workstream current vs target, the one contract
   all three frontends follow, the shared loading/error/design standard, the staging mechanism (same
   Supabase project, staging tables), and the decisions I need to make. Add the notification redesign
   and the social layer at concept level.
5. Once I approve, split the build into parallel phases and record them in BRIEF.md and HANDOFF.md.

Rules: update HANDOFF.md after every milestone so I can /compact at any time; commit + push docs via
git-version at milestones; backend changes stay compatible with every live binary in RELEASES.md;
no direct DB writes. I test on my iPhone, my Pixel and the web.
